63949	In villages, the problem is that reading material is not very available at all.” 
63950	As Kapalova hones a reputation as a national author, she has faced questions over her lack of traditionalism. 
63951	Some readers of her adaption of the famous Kyrgyz fairytale “Bugu Ene” (literally “Deer Mother”) queried why she did not set the story in the Siberian Yenisei region, which occupies a founding role in national mythology. Others asked why there was no wedding in the story. 
63952	“I took the things I liked in the original story and left out the things I didn’t need,” said Kapalova of “Bugu Ene,” which she describes as “essentially an eco-tale focused on humans’ relationship with the natural world.” 
63953	Moreover, the author, who identifies as a feminist, makes no apologies for departing from the “airy worlds” created by classical children’s authors such as Hans Christian Anderson, whose style of writing she still admires. 
63954	“It’s true that there are no fairytale weddings in my stories and there is no handsome prince,” she laughed. “None of my characters are especially waiting for him, either.” 
63955	A lethal combination: How MENA governments use cybercrime laws and spyware to target activists · Global Voices

63957	Photo widely circulated online. 
63958	This post was written by Khalid Ibrahim, executive director of the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) an independent, non-profit organisation that promotes freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in the Gulf region and its neighbouring countries. 
63959	Human rights advocate Israa Al-Ghomgham may soon be facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, for her non-violent human rights related activities. 
63960	Arrested in 2015 along with her husband, activist Mousa Al-Hashim, over their roles in anti-government protests in Al-Qatif, Al-Ghomgham was charged under article 6 of the Cybercrime Act of 2007 for "preparing, sending and storing material that would harm the public order". 
63961	She also stands accused of "inciting rallies and young people against the state and security forces on social networking sites", and posting photos and video of these protests online. 
63962	She has been in detention ever since, and was put on trial in early August 2018. 
63963	State prosecutors for her case are seeking the death penalty. 
63964	The stakes in Al-Ghomgham's case could barely be higher. But the circumstances of her arrest, detention and prosecution have become chillingly common across the MENA region. 
63965	For nearly two decades, activists like Al-Ghomgham in the MENA region have been using online tools to demand democratic societies that respect fundamental rights, and freely express other ideas that are not welcome in traditional media, which in many cases is controlled by governments. 
63966	But following the cascade of social movements across the MENA region in 2011-2012, several governments and their security forces endeavoured to tighten their controls over the internet and cripple its use to promote human rights and social justice. 
63967	In countries where human rights groups documented serious human rights violations, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Qatar, governments invested millions of dollars in surveillance, espionage and hacking tools to target human rights defenders, including internet activists and bloggers. 
63968	Alongside these technical measures, they sought out legal mechanisms to further this cause. Their tactics included the adoption and strict implementation of anti-cybercrime laws that have been used to stifle freedom of expression on the internet and to criminalise and imprison activists. 
63969	A recent report by the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR), entitled "Mapping Cybercrime Laws and Violations of Digital Rights in the Gulf and Neighbouring Countries" illustrates how this combination of technical and legal measures has led to a new era of repression in the region. 
63970	The report highlights these trends and anticipates that regional governments may expand their capacity to prosecute such "cybercrimes": 
63971	There are two trends at hand we anticipate to proliferate and feel compelled to warn against. 
63972	First, legislation will introduce more restraints on online freedom of speech and expression under the label of combating ‘fake news.’ 
63973	Second, now that the UAE and Syria have developed two branches that are specialised in the prosecution of cybercrimes i.e. the police units and courts, other countries are likely to follow suit. 
63974	In addition to using cybercrime laws as an arbitrary legal cover to target activists, governments and their security agencies hire foreign companies, often based in Western democracies, to provide them with the latest software and hardware to fully control the activities of internet activists and civil society. 
63975	In addition to monitoring and surveilling the online activities of civil society organisations, government actors have attempted to hack their accounts and obtain the sensitive data contained therein.

Emirati blogger and human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for merely expressing his opinions online, was targeted with spyware known as Finfisher and sold by Gamma International which is incorporated in the UK and Germany. 
63978	Technical research indicates that Mansoor was also targeted with software developed by Hacking Team, an Italian firm. 
63979	Through 2015 alone, authorities in the UAE used Hacking Team software bought for USD $634,500 to spy on 1,100 people. 
63980	In 2016, Mansoor was once again the target of a phishing attempt this time using the technology of the Israeli company NSO Group. 
63981	Across the region, when human rights defenders and online activists are arrested, their electronic equipment and those of their family members are confiscated. 
63982	When Mansoor was arrested in March 2017, the security forces confiscated his children’s cell phones and laptops. 
63983	As crackdowns across the MENA region continue unabated, governments in Western democracies should take action against companies that aid such repression. 
63984	EU, US and Canadian governments need to impose controls on digital security companies to prevent them from exporting censorship, blocking and spying technologies to repressive governments. 
63985	Can a controversial in-vitro fertilization process save the northern white rhino? · Global Voices "Sudan," the last male northern white rhino. 
63986	Image posted by Make It Kenya on Flickr and shared via Public Domain. 
63987	On March 19, 2018, wildlife conservationists mourned the death of a 45-year-old northern white rhinoceros named Sudan, one of the last three remaining northern white rhinos on earth, and the only surviving male. Keepers at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where Sudan lived, euthanized the ailing rhino to end his age-related suffering. 
63988	With Sudan's passing, there are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world — both female and part of Sudan's bloodline — daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu. 
63989	Scientists now hope for the continuation of the species via a controversial and highly debated in-vitro fertilization (IVF) process. 
63990	Researchers have already produced successful hybrid embryos using unfertilized eggs harvested from closely-related southern white rhino females, combined with the frozen sperm of deceased northern white rhino males. 
63991	For the first time, the resulting embryos grew to the blastocyst stage in the lab, filling scientists with the hope of saving the northern white rhino from extinction. 
63992	Now, with Najin and Fatu under 24-hour guard in Kenya to protect them from poachers, scientists intend to harvest their eggs to create viable embryos with Sudan's frozen sperm and then implant them into female southern white rhinos (a closely related subspecies), to create the first "pure" IVF northern white rhino calves. 
63993	At this point, however, the proposition is hypothetical: scientists have not yet been granted permission to extract eggs for the experimental process, but hope to receive clearance from the Kenyan government before the end of 2018. 
63994	The complex and invasive IVF process has caused a great deal of debate. 
63995	For one, the technology is expensive — experts estimate that the cost could be as high as $9 million USD — and some have questioned the practicality of pouring such heavy financial resources into saving a species that is already at the brink of extinction, rather than using the money to protect existing healthy rhino populations: 
63996	As much as we're outraged about the loss of the last male white rhino #Sudan, I find it rather (whats the word?) that we want to raise US$9 million for IVF to raise a herd (which poachers willl find a way of killing) . 
63997	Can we just let go and address other problems? pic.twitter.com/nnO0oo1eJy — Frank Hook (@FrankHook) March 20, 2018 
63998	The activist group Save the Rhino penned a statement on the controversial treatment: 
63999	A practical concern for any future Northern white rhinos successfully bred through IVF is the question of where they would live. 
64000	Much of the sub-species’ former range has lost rhinos in its entirety, with limited conservation programmes or expertise for managing a rhino population, and large-scale habitat loss. 
64001	In any case, for rhino population to be genetically viable, a minimum of 20, unrelated 'founder individuals' are needed. Otherwise, a population becomes inbred and prone to genetic abnormalities – and fertility problems. 
64002	Northern white rhinos (a subspecies of the white rhino), used to roam parts of Uganda, Chad, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but they are now extinct in the wild due to years of poaching and civil wars. 
64003	Overall, rhino numbers — regardless of species — have dropped dramatically in recent years, primarily fueled by demand for their horns. 
64004	In some Asian countries, people believe their horns can treat fevers and heart disease. In other areas, the horns are thought to symbolize wealth. 
64005	Zimbabwe tries to clamp down on illegal rhino trade 
64006	While the IVF debate continues, Sudan's death has raised awareness of the plight of rhinos throughout the African continent. 
64007	Zimbabwe, for instance, is home to both the white rhino and black rhino. 
64008	In a 2009 rhino population count, there were approximately 425 black rhinos and 300 white rhinos roaming Zimbabwean national parks and private conservancies. 
64009	In an effort to stop the illegal killing and exploitation of wild animals, the Zimbabwean government has implemented legal protections for them, under provisions set out in the Parks & Wild Life Act (PWA), which has strict consequences for offenses. 
64010	A rhino is now classified as a "specially protected animal" — hunting and killing them is prohibited, and offenders face a mandatory jail sentence of nine years on a first conviction, and 11 years on a second. 
64011	Even with a stiff penalty in place, poachers are still willing to take the risk but end up as pawns in a complex network of organized crime. 
64012	Many are poor, unemployed villagers, lured by the lucrative promise of poaching. 
64013	Combating the illegal wildlife trade must (and often doesn't) involve the arrests of those organizing it at the top. 
64014	The PWA demands forfeiture of any equipment, vehicles or weapons used for committing wildlife offenses, giving the state the right to confiscate and dispose of them as it sees fit — but despite these legal protections, change is slow in coming, and limited by a lack of adequate funding, lax law enforcement, and corruption. 
64015	A South African daily online newspaper, the Daily Maverick, reported that corruption is linked to illegal rhino horn trade not just in Zimbabwe, but in eight other African countries. 
64016	Urgent call for rhino conservation 
64017	Conservationists are urging activists and everyday citizens — especially those who reside in close proximity to the home ranges of wildlife — to take an active stance on rhino conservation. 
64018	In Zimbabwe, where 62 percent of the population is below the age of 25, the hope is that youth will play a central role in this activism thrust. 
64019	However, as more young people spend increasing amounts of time online rather than out in nature, activists must focus heavily on youth recruitment in the fight to save rhinos. 
64020	As an umbrella species, rhinos are an integral part of a rich ecosystem whose daily habits directly impact the quality of life for other species. 
64021	Their grazing, for instance, keeps the grass trim, making the terrain easier for smaller mammals to navigate. 
64022	#Researchers have proven that without #Rhinos all other animals that graze on the plains suffer. 
64023	With rhinos, the number and types of plants multiply. They give back nearly as much as they take, as the fiber in their gullet goes straight through and ends up as fertilizer. pic.twitter.com/MrSJyyDe2O — The Big White Lie (@ErrantNatives) July 17, 2018 
64024	While scientists acknowledge that extinction is a natural part of evolution, the process is occurring at a much faster rate because of poaching, habitat destruction, over-exploitation of wildlife, and even political conflict. Rhino extinction will have a profound ripple effect on other species, and Sudan's death is a glaring reminder.

64061	Graffiti art of surveillance camera. 
64062	Published and labeled for reuse on Pixabay. 
64063	It has been widely reported that software and web applications made in China are often built with a "backdoor" feature, allowing the manufacturer or the government to monitor and collect data from the user's device. 
64064	But how exactly does the backdoor feature work? Recent discussion among mobile phone users in mainland China has shed some light on the question. 
64065	Last month, users of Vivo NEX, a Chinese Android phone, found that when they opened certain applications on the phone, including Chinese internet giant QQ browser and travel booking app Ctrip, the mobile device’s camera would self-activate. 
64066	Different from most mobile phones, where a camera can be activated without giving the user any signal, the Vivo NEX has a tiny retractable camera that physically pops out from the top of the device when it is turned on. 
64067	Vivo NEX retractable camera. 
64068	Photo by Vivo NEX, via We Chaat. 
64069	Though perhaps unintentionally, this design feature has given Chinese mobile users a tangible sense of exactly when and how they are being monitored. 
64070	One Weibo user observed that the retractable camera self-activates whenever he opens a new chat on Telegram, a messaging application designed for secured and encrypted communication. 
64071	While Telegram reacted quickly to reports of the issue and fixed the camera bug, Chinese internet giant Tencent instead defended the feature, arguing that its QQ browser needs the camera activated to prepare for scanning QR codes and insisted that the camera would not take photos or audio recordings unless the user told it to do so. 
64072	This explanation was not reassuring for users, as it only revealed the degree to which the QQ browser could record users’ activities. 
64073	After the news of the self-activated camera bug spread, users started testing the issue on other applications and found that Baidu’s voice input application has access to both the camera and voice recording function, which can be launched without users’ authorization. 
64074	A Vivo NEX user found that once she had installed Baidu's voice input system, it would activate the phone’s camera and sound recording function whenever the user opened any application — including chat apps, browsers — that allows the user to input text. 
64075	Baidu says that the self-activated recording is not a backdoor but a “frontdoor” application that allows the company collect and adjust to background noise so as to prepare for and optimize its voice input function. 
64076	This was not reassuring for users — any microphone collecting background noise would also unquestionably capture the voices and conversations of a user and whomever she speaks with face-to-face. 
64077	How does camera snooping affect people outside China? These snooping features have not just affected people from mainland China, but all of those from outside the country who want to communicate with friends in China. 
64078	As the Chinese government has blocked most leading foreign social media technologies, anyone who wants to communicate with people in China has little choice but to install applications made in China, such as WeChat. 
64079	One strategy for increasing one's mobile privacy when using Chinese-made applications is to keep all insecure applications on one device and assume that these communications will be recorded or spied upon, and to keep a second device for more secure or "clean" applications. 
64080	When using an encrypted communication application like Telegram to communicate with friends in China, one also has to make sure that their friends’ mobile devices are clean. 
64081	Baidu has been notorious for snooping into users’ private data and activities. In January 2018, a government-affiliated consumer association in Jiangsu province filed a lawsuit against Baidu’s search application and mobile browser for snooping on users' phone conversations and accessing their geo-location data without user consent. 
64082	But the case was dropped in March after Baidu updated its applications by securing users’ consent for control over their mobile camera, voice recording, geo-location data, even though these controls are not essential to the application's functionality. 
64083	In response to public concern about these backdoor features, Baidu and other Chinese internet giants may defend themselves simply by arguing that users have consented to having their cameras activated. But given the monopolistic nature of Chinese Internet giants in the country, do ordinary users have the power — or the choice — to say no? 
64084	Bangladesh Is the World's 'Most Vegetarian Country'? Not Quite. · Global Voices 
64085	Fish on display in a fish market in Sylhet. 
64086	Image from Flickr by David Stanley. 
64087	CC By 2.0 
64088	A recent article published by British newspaper the Telegraph named Bangladesh as the "most vegetarian country in the world". 
64089	The report cited a 2009 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which showed that only four kilos of meat are consumed by each Bangladeshi in a year, a stark contrast to the 120 kilos of meat consumed by a person in the US. 
64090	However, social media commenters were quick to point out that the label of "vegetarian" was inaccurate: Bangladeshis consume very little meat because fish is a traditional staple and because meat is generally expensive. 
64091	Sumit Kumar Banshal from New Delhi, India, warned readers to base their judgment on the Telegraph's article in its entirety, not just on the misleading "vegetarian" headline: 
64092	This is stating the lowest consumption of meat per capita as the vegetarian country!! First of all low meat consumption does not make one vegetarian even metaphorically!! 
64093	Secondly, Bangladesh is a fish eater country at first place so there should be less consumption of meat!! 
64094	Very ill-use of statistical inference in this article!! 
64095	Bangladesh is one of the most populous countries of the world with an estimated 163 million people in 2016 in an area of 56,980 square miles (147,570 square kilometers). 
64096	It has a largely agricultural economy and the staple food of Bangladeshis is rice, fish, and daal (lentil) with a wide range of other curries. 
64097	Bangladesh is renowned for its sweet water fish cultivation and it stands fourth in the world in terms of fish production. 
64098	Given that it is a majority Muslim country, proteins such as beef and poultry feature more prominently on menus that include meat. 
64099	However, a lot of vegetarian dishes are common in households, because average Bangladeshis, especially those living in rural areas, often cannot afford meat as a component of all their meals. 
64100	Expat Bangladeshi IT professional Bickey Russell commented on Facebook about a typical urban food menu in Bangladesh: 
64101	I'm not an expert by any means, but to my knowledge, Bengali culinary heritage is mostly all about fish and vegetables. 
64102	While growing up in Dhaka in the late 90's, beef/chicken were not everyday items served at home. 
64103	Sure, Bangladeshi food has some amazing meat dishes (e.g. kacchi, tehari, kababs etc etc.), but these are still fairly "modern" introductions to the cuisine. 
64104	Also, meat is still super expensive for the average person/family in the country. 
64105	According to an op-ed in the Dhaka Tribune by Mahmood Sadi, "The per capita meat requirement of Bangladesh is 43.25 kilos, but the availability of it is only 9.12 kilos, indicating an almost 79 percent deficit. 
64106	Because of the lack of purchasing power, the consumption came down to about four kilos." 
64107	The lack of purchasing power indicates that meat is becoming dearer in Bangladesh for a variety of reasons. 
64108	Sadi notes that almost half of the meat consumption in Bangladesh is red meat, mostly from cows. 
64109	Bangladesh needs more than 3 million cows to meet the demand; around 1 million cows are sourced from within the country, and the rest are legal and illegal imports of cows from neighboring India. 
64110	In 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) party came to power and took a number of steps to protect cows as cattle are considered sacred in the Hindu religion. 
64111	In the subsequent years, India has allowed fewer cattle to be exported to Bangladesh, which led to a 50% spike in the price of beef, significantly more than the world average. 
64112	As a result, beef is now a luxury for many poor in the country and there is an increase in consumption of other forms of protein.

64116	Some opinions were harsh in criticizing the Telegraph claim, which earned coverage in some local news outlets of Bangladesh. 
64117	Shayan S. Khan, a commenter on Facebook, lashed out: 
64118	It's bad enough that some travel journalist at the Telegraph goofed up badly trying to be clever with some statistics, it's way more tragic though when it gets unquestioningly republished in our media, the level of daftness is unbearable. 
64119	Development worker Rashed Rahgir questioned the hype:

64122	Many pointed out that the majority of Bangladeshis do not adhere to a vegetarian lifestyle; the president of the Vegetarian Society of Bangladesh claimed only a very small portion of people may be vegetarians. 
64123	Marie, the author of a vegan travel blog, noted that in Bangladeshi cuisine there are often traces of meat in the food and its hard to get a decent vegetarian meal. 
64124	And Nadia Khan commented on Facebook: 
64125	You can’t even find a decent vegetarian place in Bangladesh less talk about most people eating vegetables mostly! 
64126	In Syria, regime loyalists use art as a tool of war · Global Voices 
64127	The Syrian conflict has plunged the country into a vortex of death and destruction, and triggered a humanitarian crisis with little precedent, so much so that it seems inconceivable that any of this macabre reality can be associated with aesthetics. 
64128	Nonetheless, the warring sides have invoked aesthetic representations of the war — that have sometimes bordered on the romantic — in an attempt to get across tailored messages serving propaganda purposes. 
64129	A military state has crept into forms of expression that are predominantly thought to be at variance with war and militarization. This has been evident in drama, art, fashion, pop music and other spheres. And nowhere has this been more blatant than in regime circles. 
64130	Since the early days of the revolution, the Syrian regime has idolized and romanticized a military state. 
64131	At the entrance of Lattakia coastal province, the birthplace of the Syrian dictator, a gigantic military boot filled with flowers greets arrivals. 
64132	Similar jackboots are scattered across areas under government control. 
64133	The Syrian regime's media has been keen to show lavish outpourings of affection for the Syrian military, with prominent figures and ordinary citizens shown 'kissing' the military boot in reverence as a token of loyalty and gratitude. 
64134	Many believe that these scenes ride roughshod over the feelings of the locals who have lost loved ones, lost homes or both, which is thought to further inflame sentiments in a country reeling from a devastating war. 
64135	This is especially felt because these series seek to bear out the regime's narrative of events which blame the rebels for the city's wholesale destruction. 
64136	In October 2017, a loyalist Syrian fashion designer, Manal Ajaj, sparked controversy when she posed on the catwalk with models dressed in Syrian military uniforms during a fashion show in Beirut in what she said was a "homage to the Syrian army". 
64137	Last month, Bashar Assad and his wife Asma visited an underground tunnel dug by rebels (who were branded as terrorists by the regime) after the Syrian regime's takeover of eastern Ghouta in April. 
64138	A group of Assad-supporting artists turned the tunnel into an "art gallery", according to the Syrian state news agency. 
64139	In support of the artists' work, Bashar Assad was quoted as saying: 
64140	Destruction, darkness and death are the culture of terrorists, while construction, light, life and art are our own.

64148	A key part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policy of economic reforms, dubbed "Womenomics", also involves getting more women into the workforce. 
64149	While this policy has achieved some limited success, domestic reforms alone are unlikely to be enough to fill the gaps in the labor market. "We are opening up our country." 
64150	In response to this growing concern, on September 14, 2018, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told the World Economic Forum that Japan needs to admit more foreign workers, claiming that the current policy was incapable of sustaining Japanese society. 
64151	"We are opening up our country," said Kono. 
64152	"We are now trying to come up with a new work permit policy so I think everyone shall be welcome in Japan if they are willing to assimilate into Japanese society." 
64153	Prime Minister Abe also recently announced plans to attract 500,000 foreign workers to Japan by 2025 to fill chronic labor shortages in farming, construction, accommodation, and elder care by creating a new five-year visa category for non-professional foreign laborers. 
64154	In order to support its graying citizenry and stabilize its population at 100 million, Japan would need to accept a whopping 200,000 immigrants each year. 
64155	The country had 1.28 million foreign workers as of October 2017, with Chinese workers making up the largest portion at nearly 30 percent, followed by those from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Brazil. 
64156	Non-Japanese cashiers are becoming more and more common, with non-Japanese workers accounting for some 5 percent of convenience store chain FamilyMart's employees. 
64157	As urban areas become increasingly international, one out of ten 20-somethings living in Tokyo are now foreign-born. For twenty-year-olds living in Tokyo, that number increases to one in eight. 
64158	For some people, immigration is already a reality in Japan. 
64159	While Japan is busy arguing about whether or not to accept immigrants, they're already coming in, and it's not as if there's a ban on immigration or anything. 
64160	Tokyo is pretty much a haven for immigrants at this point. A focus on temporary "trainees", not "migrants" 
64161	Many foreign workers enter the country via the "technical intern trainee" system, a 1990 program designed to transfer technical skills. 
64162	Critics see the scheme as encouraging simple and cheap labor by allowing businesses in the industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors to cheaply hire youth from abroad. 
64163	Trainees cannot change jobs, and there have been numerous reports of their being subjected to illegally long work hours and physical abuse from employers. Vietnamese trainees were even made to take part in nuclear decontamination work in Fukushima. 
64164	Twitter user Mulboyne shared a Mainichi newspaper report about a Vietnamese worker who, after being left with only the equivalent of US$200 per month in pay despite working full-time, found a better-paying job by working under the table: 
64165	Although she kept her head down, police found her when conducting an investigation into another matter. She was arrested in April. 
64166	The article notes her co-workers said she was a hard worker, very diligent and never late. — Mulboyne (@Mulboyne) August 30, 2018 
64167	While trainees are currently able to stay for a maximum of five years, Abe's proposed reforms would allow those who have completed the program to stay for up to five additional years. 
64168	However, the focus remains on encouraging temporary stays over permanent immigration. 
64169	Trainees would be unable to bring their families with them, and must temporarily return to their home countries after finishing the program. This would technically prevent them from applying for permanent residency because one of the requirements is to have lived in Japan for ten years or more. 
64170	"Japan's peace and harmony is based on it being a homogeneous country" 
64171	While Japan is already accepting more foreign workers, not everyone is comfortable with this change. 
64172	"Many people in Japan believe that the country's peace and harmony is based on it being a homogeneous country where there are few foreigners," says Chris Burgess, a migration researcher and lecturer of Japan studies at Tsuda Juku University in Tokyo, in an interview with CNN. 
64173	According to Burgess, underlying this belief is the so-called "foreign crime" debate, the fear that allowing in greater numbers of foreigners will harm public safety—a fear that has only been heightened in recent years by terrorist atrocities in Europe and other countries with high migration levels. 
64174	A recent poll shows that public opinion on this issue is mixed. 
64175	A public opinion poll conducted by the Nikkei found opinion evenly split about whether Japan should admit more foreign workers, with 42% agreeing and 42% disagreeing. 
64176	However, age was a large determining factor when it came to how people voted. Roughly 60% of 18-29-year-olds were for increased immigration, while just 30% were against it. 
64177	The opposite trend was found among those aged 70 or older, with 30% for and 45% against. 
64178	Young people are perhaps more accepting of foreigners as they are the ones directly affected by population shrinking, and they have grown up with the effects of globalization. 
64179	In this video from Asian Boss, reporters hit the streets to find out how ordinary Japanese feel about the issue: 
64180	While some interviewees were resistant to the idea of hiring foreign workers, others identified a need for Japanese people to accept people of various nationalities and to become more open-minded. 
64181	"The Japanese love Americans and accept them, but to people from other Asian countries, the Japanese tend to be unkind," one young woman explained. 
64182	Whether Japan will become a truly multicultural nation any time in the foreseeable future remains uncertain, but it is clear that increasing globalization is already having an impact on the nation. 
64183	As for how demographic changes will shape Japan, only time will tell. 
64184	'Crimes of solidarity' in Europe multiply as 11 stand trial in Belgium for helping migrants · Global Voices 
64185	The September 6, 2018, trial of 11 people who have helped migrants in Belgium has attracted a number of protesters. 
64186	Photo: Melissa Vida. Used with permission. 
64187	Eleven people who had been arrested and charged with human trafficking in October 2017 appeared in court in Brussels on September 6, the first hearing of a trial that activists say is yet another case of "criminalization of solidarity" in Europe. 
64188	The defendants have allegedly assisted 95 undocumented migrants, including 12 minors, to travel from Belgium to the United Kingdom last year, either by hosting them in their homes, by lending them phones and thereby indirectly helping them cross the channel. 
64189	On the day of the trial, three hundred people protested in front of the courthouse. 
64190	Demonstrators say this is a political trial, aimed at dissuading people from helping migrants by establishing an intimidating judicial precedent. 
64191	The defendants are two Belgian journalists, one Belgian-Morrocan social worker, a Tunisian man who is a legal Belgian resident and seven people who are undocumented migrants themselves. 
64192	Eight of the defendants have been in jail since the arrest. 
64193	Belgian law states that there must be a monetary transaction involved for an act to be framed as human trafficking, something the defendants deny ever happening. 
64194	However, the relationship between the migrants and their helpers seems to fall into a legal grey area, raising fears that the law's scope is unjustly being expanded to target activists. 
64195	Myriam Berghe, one of the two journalists, said in an interview with RTBF (Belgium's public service broadcaster) that she's received money on behalf of a migrant she was hosting. 
64196	The migrant in question had been sent money from abroad via Western Union, Berghe says, but had no way of collecting it due to having no papers. 
64197	What for Berghe was simply an act of kindness, in the eyes of the authorities was payment for smuggling. 
64198	In the same interview, she explains that despite some of the people she's hosted being smugglers themselves, she wouldn't consider them "human traffickers": 
64199	Yes, I've hosted smugglers. 
64200	But you need to understand what is the reality we're talking about. 
64201	The 12 people indicted in this case don't have anything to do with what the law calls "human trafficking." 
64202	They're clueless youngsters that try to survive by becoming small smugglers until they save up enough to cross the border themselves. 
64203	Bergue and Anouk Van Gestel, the other journalist, have written an open letter to the Belgian prime minister. 
64204	In this excerpt, they express their dismay at the current state of Belgium’s democracy: 
64205	Is it acceptable that in a country that calls itself a democracy, two citizens are indicted for criminal association and human trafficking, with the aggravating factor that it involves minors, because they opened their door to people who were in total distress? 
64206	On the day of the trial, Selma Benkhelifa, one of the defense's lawyers, remembered how Interior Minister Jan Jambon has blamed the squatting of Maximilien Park, which is home for hundreds of migrants in Brussels, on the people who help them. 
64207	She said: 
64208	It is a trial that is eminently political. 
64209	Jan Jambon declared that the situation at Maximilian Park was the responsibility of the hosts. 
64210	We first hear these very provocative declarations and afterwards we notice that there are real lawsuits that are filed. 
64211	This is only the latest event around border control policies that have deeply impacted European politics in recent years. 
64212	In Brussels, 10,000 people marched in February against anti-migrant government policies. 
64213	In May, the death of a four-year-old Kurd asylum seeker at the hands of Belgian police caused widespread outrage. 
64214	More recently, the government's reopening of a detention center for undocumented families also drew criticism from human rights workers. 
64215	People who have helped undocumented immigrants have also stood trials in other Europeans countries. 
64216	In France, helping undocumented migrants was illegal until June 2018. 
64217	In Italy, a Spanish charity that helps migrant's boats stranded at sea is under investigation, while in Switzerland a pastor was fined €1,112 for hosting an undocumented Togolese migrant in his church. 
64218	In Spain, human rights activist and researcher Helena Maleno was charged with human trafficking after helping to save dinghies in the Mediterranean. 
64219	Maleno says there are currently 45 lawsuits undergoing in different courts in Europe with people facing criminal charges after helping undocumented migrants. 
64220	Maleno herself is still under investigation by the Moroccan authorities.

64224	Massive student demonstrations against violence have swept through Mexico City during the month of September 2018. 
64225	Today's students face similar issues to those who marched fifty years ago with the Mexican Movement of 1968, a series of protests and demonstrations demanding an end to state-sanctioned violence. 
64226	Today, the struggle to stop the violence continues as 30,000 university students including those from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico's largest public university gathered on September 6, 2018, for a massive demonstration: 
64227	HISTORICAL! 
64228	Thousands and thousands of students from UNAM, IPN, UAM, UACM, ENAH, UPN, regular students (among many others) came to CU with a demand: 
64229	Porros out of UNAM! 
64230	Porros out of universities! 
64231	This protest was organized in response to events three days prior when shock groups, also known as "porros", allegedly attacked students within the College of Sciences and Humanities. 
64232	The students were peacefully calling for more faculty hires as well as justice for the murder of CCH Oriente student Miranda Mendoza, who was killed in late August 2018. 
64233	Protestors’ general demands include increased security within the dozens of UNAM's faculties, schools, centers, and research institutions. They also demand the expulsion of porro groups who allegedly receive political or economic bonuses in exchange for violently attacking student demonstrations and destabilizing university life. 
64234	"We are the grandchildren of '68" 
64235	Today's demonstrations symbolically mark the 50th anniversary of the Mexican Movement of 1968 whose similar demands included the release of political prisoners, the resignation of the ruling party, and expansion of political liberties as well as democratic changes in efforts to eradicate authoritarianism. 
64236	At the time, the government viewed these protests as an attempted coup d'état by communist groups and a threat to national security and responded with aggression and force. 
64237	Several marches, sit-ins, demonstrations, and protests ensued in 1968 including the "March of Silence" on September 13, 1968, during which protesters covered their mouths with white bandannas to protest the government's silence about the Movement along with their use of brutal force against students in prior marches that year. 
64238	On October 2, 1968, over 10,000 students organized a peaceful march in the Tlatelolco area of Mexico City but their gathering was violently repressed by the Mexican government. Over 300 people were killed and the tragedy is remembered today as "The Massacre of Tlatelolco." 
64239	Today, as the anniversaries of these historical events approach, students felt a solidarity with history and decided to replicate the March of Silence on its anniversary date, September 13, 2018, to honor the people who marched on these same streets for similar causes. 
64240	Fifty years later, marches, memorials, and photographs contrasting protests of past and present have been shared through social media with hashtags such as #MarchaDelSilencio and #A50Del68:

64244	Animal Político has published a series of chronicles from 1968, released on the same dates as historical marches. 
64245	Other journalists like Leopoldo Gómez have taken a closer look at the student movement of yesterday and today: 
64246	No longer is the protest about repression, but governmental incompetence. In 1968, protestors fought against governmental excesses; now they demand more, they want a good government. 
64247	Fifty years later the demand is the same: an end to impunity. 
64248	In 1968, they wanted to end impunity within the government itself, and in 2018, the call is to end impunity for criminals the government secretly conducts business with. 
64249	The endemic violence in Mexico, where more than 70 people are murdered daily, is only partial cause for the protests. This year also marks the fourth anniversary of the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa, who were each remembered:

64251	Historian Octavio Solís notes the symbolic force of the 1968 protests in which "imagination defeated power": 
64252	"The student movement of 1968 gathered the demands of several social spheres that had been unable to find a way to speak out. To each repressive act or attempt at control, an imaginative and forceful response arose The movement only lasted two months, but as it is often repeated, there are days, weeks, and months that can contain whole years in themselves Like these young people's bet for silence that poured dignity into oblivion: a living image that lasts till today, a half century later."

64256	As China prepares to remove the two-term limit on the presidency from its constitution, there is speculation as to whether the country is going to return to the era of dynasties, where the empire was ruled by powerful families. 
64257	The authoritarian nature of dynasties has led to a common stereotype of Chinese people as obedient and submissive. 
64258	This stereotype fails to account for the fact that while much of China's history has been dominated by dynastic cycle, this cycle was in fact punctuated by the overthrowing of powerful emperors by popular revolutions or military coups which ended up with the country in chaos before another dynasty was established. 
64259	The first civil revolution recorded in China’s history took place in 221 BC. Liu Bang, who served as a minor patrol officer and led the revolution, went on to found the Han dynasty. 
64260	Liu was not the only civilian emperor. The founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, also came from a poor peasant family. Wu Zetian, the most famous empress in Chinese history, was the daughter of a businessman and married into the royal family as a concubine. 
64261	The rebellious spirit of the knights-errant 
64262	In other words, the history of dynasties in China is also a history of rebellions, and that rebellious spirit is embodied in classic Chinese literature in the spirit of the knight-errant. Among the literary figures who embraced the rebellious spirit are Sima Qian and Li Bai. 
64263	Sima was a historian of the early Han dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). 
64264	He dedicated a chapter of his famous "Records of the Grand Historian" to the knights-errant, whom he described as civilians trustworthy for their promises, fast to act in response to people’s needs and possessing their own system of justice. 
64265	He expressed admiration for the knights-errant even when they acted against the law, because they adhered to the form of justice endorsed by the common people. Liang Kai's drawing (1140-1210) of Li Bai, the genius poet. 
64266	Li Bai was a poet widely acclaimed as a genius, and also a self-described knight-errant. He served the emperor for a short period, but spent most of his time wandering around and making friends. 
64267	In his famous poem (a drinking song), "Bring in the wine", he expressed his love of freedom and friendship and looked down on money and the societal status quo. 
64268	When we are happy, 
64269	Shan't we fully enjoy ourselves? 
64270	Drink up the golden chalices, my friends 
64271	Never let them empty to the moon 
64272	Life has its own meaning 
64273	No matter how much I spend 
64274	It will eventually come back to me 
64275	A luxury life is not my dream 
64276	My dream is to drink and drink and never wake up 
64277	All men of virtue are lonely 
64278	Only the drinkers are remembered 
64279	Film director Ang Lee’s award-winning film, ‘Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon’ is categorized in the west as belonging to the martial arts genre. In the Chinese-speaking world, however, it is considered a ‘Wu-Xia’ film—‘wu’ meaning the martial arts or Kung Fu, and ‘xia’ referring to the spirit of the knights-errant. 
64280	Bearing this in mind, the film can be enjoyed from a cultural perspective as well as for its fantastic displays of martial arts. 
64281	It is believed that the Chinese dynastic emperors had absolute power, but this was not, in fact, the case. 
64282	The Chinese emperors did rule based on the will of God, but ‘God’ is a vague idea in China, which has never had a single national religion. 
64283	This idea is also contained in the Chinese proverb, "water holds up the boat, and water sinks the boat," which is taken from an important historical document. 
64284	The "boat" in the proverb is referred to the emperor, and "water" is referred to the people. 
64285	When the emperor lost the people’s hearts, the proverb says, the knights-errant trusted by the people could rise up in rebellion. 
64286	Rebels from Classic Chinese Literature 
64287	China's most famous rebellion novel is "Water Margin", or ‘Outlaws of the Marsh’, attributed to Shi Nai'an. It tells the story of 108 rebels, including 3 women, from different backgrounds who gather in Mount Liang to confront the corrupt government. The rebels are knights-errant, all very gifted and brave. 
64288	Their mission is to confront the dynasty, which makes them more romantic and heroic than Robin Hood. 
64289	This story is loved by the Chinese working class because of its spirit of rebellion, so it is not surprising that the novel was banned by both the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China. 
64290	Mao Zedong, who led the Chinese Communist Party to win the Chinese Civil War and became the founding father of the People’s Republic of China, was known to have loved "Water Margin". He used to say that he and his comrades were forced by the corrupt Kuomintang to go to Mount Liang, just like the 108 rebels in the novel.

64293	Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" inspired He-Zhai Jin to write a new novel, "Wukong". This novel was later adapted into a movie directed by Hong Konger, Derek Kwok. 
64294	Critics considered this film a fairy tale for the post-Umbrella Hong Kong, in which some of the people never submit to destiny and always fight for their freedom. 
64295	Fa Mulan is another brave and independent Chinese figure of legend who is also known by many westerners through the animated Disney film, "Mulan". 
64296	Mulan disguises herself as a man in order to fight in the war. Because of her achievements on the battlefield, the emperor invites her to work for the government, but she turns down the offer and returns to her family. 
64297	Although the figure of Mulan challenges the role of women in China's patriarchal society, she is still a beloved figure in China—perhaps because she chooses to obey the emperor and become a warrior, and most importantly, because she does not wish for power. 
64298	Few of China's literary works and legends of rebellion end as peacefully as Mulan. 
64299	The most outstanding and respected knight-errant in "Records of the Grand Historian" is executed by the dynasty. 
64300	The rebels in "Water Margin" end up surrendering to the dynasty and dying in the war. 
64301	In "Journey to the West", Wukong is captured by the Gods and later controlled by a golden ring on his head similar to the caps in The Tripods series. Even the Empress Wu Zetian was smeared as a whore, and her achievement had been ignored for a long time because she dared to wield power over men. 
64302	But these stories continue to be passed from generation to generation in spite of their tragic endings because they embody a spirit of disobedience and rebellion, an eternal source of inspiration for the Chinese people. 
64303	To see the full brutality of ICE's impact on immigrants, look inside U.S. borders too · Global Voices 
64304	U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) SWAT officers in 2004.

64306	The policy of separating children from their parents at U.S. borders pursued by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has been the target of significant outrage and condemnation over the past few months. 
64307	Yet little attention has been paid to the manner in which immigration enforcement is carried out by ICE within U.S. borders. 
64308	In July 2018, ICE carried out one of its largest raids in years, arresting more than 140 people in the state of Ohio. 
64309	The Trump administration has attempted to justify aggressive immigration enforcement by claiming it helps make cities safer, yet the opposite may be true. 
64310	Simply put, the enforcement policies of ICE are destroying the social fabric of communities in the U.S. 
64311	Immigration advocates have raised concerns about ICE’s track record of abuse, militarized operations and propensity to identify themselves as the police. 
64312	So far this year, seven immigrants have died while in ICE custody, with reports citing lack of medical care as a primary factor. 
64313	The cavalier attitude with which ICE conducts operations should be a cause of concern for everyone, especially given that ICE has negligently detained or deported more than 20,000 U.S. citizens since 2003. 
64314	The terror that ICE raids sow in communities affects us all. 
64315	In immigrant communities this fear often results in a reluctance to call the police, cooperate with authorities or show up in court, the effects of which have already started to show. 
64316	In 2017, sexual assault reports by Latinos in Los Angeles fell by 25 percent, while domestic violence reports declined by 10 percent. 
64317	In Denver, Colorado, prosecutors reported that victims of domestic violence have refused to testify out of fear following ICE arrests in the local courthouse. 
64318	The threat to our collective security extends to public health as well. 
64319	Widespread fear has led to immigrants forgoing healthcare for themselves and even their U.S. citizen children, increasing health risks for all. 
64320	ICE's violence also has direct and tangible effects. A 2017 study by the University of Michigan documented health outcomes following a 2008 ICE raid in Iowa. The study found that Latina women, including those who were U.S. citizens, were more likely to give birth to low birth-weight or premature babies following the raid. 
64321	While the immediate effects on health and safety have been documented, the long-term effects will take decades to be fully understood. 
64322	This includes not only the great trauma inflicted on children separated from their parents while in immigration custody, but also the devastating disruption of their education due to ICE raids. 
64323	After raids took place in eastern Tennessee earlier this year, more than 500 children missed school the following day. 
64324	The fear and instability that accompanies these raids have thrust school officials into a role that has now become all too common for teachers, health-care professionals and social workers attempting to provide some sense of guidance and reassurance in a time of immense uncertainty. 
64325	A survey of 5,400 teachers, principals and counselors conducted by the Civil Rights Project at UCLA found that 68 percent of administrators cited absenteeism among immigrant students as a problem, and 70 percent of principals and counselors reported academic decline among immigrant students. 
64326	These collateral consequences are rarely cited in conversations on immigration and enforcement, but they highlight the human costs that we collectively pay. 
64327	The United States detains more immigrants than any other country in the world, and ICE’s ballooning budget and expansive detention policies run the risk of reshaping the character of our country. 
64328	Evidence documenting the destructive effects of ICE enforcement paints a clear picture as to the devastating toll these policies are taking on our society. 
64329	We must stand together to protect our communities and call for an end to destructive policies that separate our families and destroy the social fabric of our communities.

64331	Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Shawkan to be released soon after five years in prison · Global Voices 
64332	Egyptian photo journalist Shawkan is set to be released after spending five years in prison. 
64333	Widely shared photo by Ayman Aref. 
64334	Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Shawkan was sentenced by a Cairo Criminal Court to five years in prison for covering the 2013 clashes of Rab'aa El Adaweya sit-in dispersal. 
64335	But since he has been in detention for more than five years already, his lawyer said he will be able to walk free in the next few days. 
64336	Shawkan's verdict was part of a mass trial that included 739 people charged after the violent dispersal of a protest camp in support of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. 
64337	During the same trial, 75 prominent members and affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood were sentenced to death. 
64338	Shawkan, 31, was accused of murder and being affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood which has been designated as a terrorist group by several governments in the region. 
64339	President Morsi was toppled from power after mass demonstrations took place against the latter in late June of 2013. 
64340	Morsi's ouster, which was led by incumbent President Abdelfattah el Sisi, was followed by one of the most violent crackdowns on Islamists and dissents, leaving a vacuum in the opposition scene in Egypt. 
64341	Prolonged Detention 
64342	Shawkan's detention has been prolonged because of postponed trials without having ratified official charges. 
64343	Both charges and trial postponements have been criticized by the public and led to global campaigns calling for Shawkan's release. 
64344	Some of the groups which campaigned for his freedom include Press Behind Bars, Press Uncuffed, Freedom for Shawkan, and Shawkan Photo Awards - a contest that aims to distinguish photojournalism in Egypt. 
64345	Torah prison, one of the most famous jails across Egypt known for harboring political prisoners, was where Shawkan has been detained. 
64346	In March 2015, Shawkan wrote a letter published by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), describing Torah prison as a cemetery:

64351	The “kitchenette” is adjacent to a squat-down drop toilet, which is basically a hole in the concrete floor.

64377	Will Syria follow in the UAE's footsteps and censor VoIP services? · Global Voices 
64378	Millions of Syrians displaced by the war rely on VoIP apps to stay in touch with their loved ones. 
64379	Photo by samer daboul from Pexels 
64380	This post, written by Grant Baker, was first published on smex.org. 
64381	This edited version is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
64382	On October 17, the Syrian Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (TRA) announced that it may soon begin blocking voice and video calls on WhatsApp and other Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. The TRA said it would do this to increase revenues in the telecommunications industry, according to a Al-Watan, a newspaper linked to the Syrian regime. 
64383	The regulator's general-director Ibaa Oueichek complained that VoIP “lowers the return on investment for companies and reduces their incentive to make new investments to improve the network and offer better services for a lower price.” 
64384	Like other governments in the region, and in sub-Saharan Africa, the promise of increased revenues for locally administrated telecommunications companies is attractive, despite the burdens it would place on citizens. 
64385	If implemented, such a ban would increase the already-high costs of communication in the country and decrease flows of information. 
64386	It would also present a threat to Syrians' rights to privacy and would likely lead to greater self-censorship in the country. 
64387	Currently, two companies maintain a duopoly on Syria's mobile telecommunication market: SyriaTel, owned by Bashar al-Assad’s cousin Rami Makhlouf, and MTN Syria, a subsidiary of the South Africa-based MTN Group Limited. 
64388	The regime controls the internet infrastructure and bandwidth via two government agencies, the Syrian Computer Society (SCG) and the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE). 
64389	The SCG controls the country's 3G infrastructure while the STE, which in 1999 commissioned the country's first nationwide monitoring system, owns all fixed-line infrastructure. 
64390	This allows the Syrian authorities to easily spy on users. 
64391	If WhatsApp and other encrypted VoIP services were to be censored, Syrians would have no choice but to use the government-controlled telecommunication services, leaving their private communications more vulnerable to government spying 
64392	This means that the Syrian government could easily listen in on their conversations and collect their communications metadata. It has been well-documented that the government purchases and uses various surveillance tools to spy on citizens. 
64393	It is easy to imagine that if Syrians had no choice but to use local telecommunications services, authorities would take advantage of their relatively insecure technology and increase their habit of spying on the population. 
64394	Such a shift could also create a pathway for expensive and dangerous new alternatives. 
64395	The United Arab Emirates government, which bans VoIP services including Skype, Viber and WhatsApp, has only allowed the country's two mobile operators, Etisalat and Du, to roll out their own VoIP services. 
64396	Not only do these services cost money, but the government of the UAE also has access to customers' metadata and call information, which facilitates surveillance. 
64397	In an effort to increase profits, the telecommunications companies in Syria could roll out similar services. 
64398	The new services might give citizens the illusion that their communications were protected, when in reality they would be just as vulnerable as regular calls. 
64399	While users in Syria could still circumvent this ban by downloading a VPN, this will exclude those who are not tech savvy and who have limited financial means. 
64400	Most VPNs cost money and those that are free often track browsing and give third parties access to user data, creating added vulnerabilities for users. 
64401	If the telecom industry regulator approves the blocking of VoIP services, Syria will be the latest country in the region to adopt such a restrictive policy. 
64402	In addition to the UAE, Qatar currently blocks access to VoIP services, while Saudi Arabia still bans Viber and WhatsApp after easing its restrictions on the use of VoIP apps last year. 
64403	Other countries in the region, like Lebanon and Morocco, briefly blocked access to VoIP in 2010 and 2016, respectively but quickly ended these initiatives. "Because we're here. 
64404	Because we exist": Nofi 'Black and Proud' challenges representation in French media · Global Voices 
64405	Christian Dzellat - Photo taken by Sophie Palmier with their permission 
64406	Nofi, a media channel founded in 2014, has billed itself "the first for black culture" in France. 
64407	Creator Christian Dzellat takes pride in the use of "direct speech" to reach a community hindered by a major deficit in representation in mainstream French media. 
64408	Nofi's Facebook page connects with more than 1.8 million followers and the website draws in an average of 500,000 visitors per month, with a burgeoning community growing on Instagram with 83,000 members. 
64409	Its editorial content tackles a slew of news, lifestyle and black cultural history topics. 
64410	At times controversial, as over the launch of their print magazine Negus, the channel works to raise awareness of black representation in French society, which tends to get cold feet when it comes to talking about race and black culture. 
64411	In an interview with American actor Jada Pinkett-Smith, Dzellat describes the vision behind Nofi: 
64412	This is the first French-speaking black medium ... our target is really to promote black excellence and raise our peoples' consciousness. 
64413	Global Voices sat down with Dzellat to learn more about the making of Nofi. 
64414	Global Voices (GV): Why did you decide to set up a site in addition to your existing Facebook page? 
64415	The idea was to go further. 
64416	'Nofi' is a contraction of 'noir et fier' , from a T-shirt of that name I created in 2004. 
64417	At that time the only social network I had to bring was the street. 
64418	The idea of that T-shirt was to connect people, to model greater solidarity between people from the black community. 
64419	There are Blacks from Africa, Blacks from the Caribbean, Malians, Senegalese, Congolese... 
64420	For me, at 22, it was necessary to kind of try and unify all that under a single banner. 
64421	From that springboard, we created the 'black and proud' Facebook page, and the impact was swift, because we got in there early, back in 2008-9. 
64422	We talked about anything that touched the black community in current affairs and entertainment terms. 
64423	Then we wanted to go further, because Facebook is ... you know, Facebook. 
64424	We wanted to create a real channel. 
64425	We worked up to our content level rather than just sharing. 
64426	And from that, Nofi was born on February 21, 2014 — the anniversary of Malcolm X's assassination. 
64427	We wanted a strong symbol. 
64428	So here we are on the inside, for four years now, with editors and journalists. 
64429	And we're developing a parallel agency business, working with brands like Netflix and Orange. 
64430	(Ed's note: Orange is one of the largest telecom/media companies in France). 
64431	Black American model - CC0 Creative Commons 
64432	GV: Who are you addressing with Nofi? 
64433	CD: We're addressing mainly Blacks, but also lovers of Afro culture, black culture, as a whole. 
64434	And then, ultimately, just like Le Monde or Figaro, we address everyone. 
64435	The idea being that everyone can find something to their liking here. 
64436	GV: Can a bid like Nofi's help shift the boundaries of representation in the wider media? 
64437	CD: I've come to appreciate that when you start to be visible, to have an audience, people — and that includes the media, our own peers — start to look more closely at you. 
64438	To give you an example: the editorial team at AJ+ are always looking at Nofi — they've already written to us to ask us to help them share certain content which might touch our audience. 
64439	And when I look today at what they're producing, I can spot that we're inspiring them: they have a more direct language than 1 or 2 years ago - they speak 'black', straight to the point. 
64440	And then there are questions which can't be handled except by the people concerned. 
64441	Too often certain subjects in France are approached in news stories, but not nailed. 
64442	I'm not going to go talking about the history of the city of Paris if I haven't done the research, or if I'm not a historian. 
64443	GV: Might this approach also contribute to getting more black journalists and editors into publishing in general? 
64444	CD: Absolutely. That's very important. 
64445	I'm happy that we can contribute to giving a break to journalism college graduates. 
64446	For example, our managing editor started out with an internship at Nofi. Three years later, she was managing editor, and maybe later on she'll continue her path somewhere else. All the better. You've got to be in the vanguard for things to become the norm later. 
64447	GV: Do you keep tabs on bloggers who might be of interest to you from the point of view of giving Nofi more content? 
64448	CD: We try, but it's not straightforward. 
64449	Since today we have major visibility, when we have a need, we put a call out on the network. 
64450	That often gets passed by word of mouth, or via unsolicited offers. 
64451	But keeping actual tabs is rare: it only works for the really out-there stuff. 
64452	GV: What's your business model? 
64453	CD: Like many content managers, we have a very complex, advertising revenue business model. 
64454	But it's not enough. That's why we created our agency: today we do consulting, we produce content, as we've been able to do recently for Orange We have to scout further afield. 
64455	We also do a bit of merchandizing, like we did at the start with the 'black and proud' T-shirt. And some publishing — we had a book out recently. 
64456	We diversify by staying in the same dynamic and the same environment to keep overall consistency. 
64457	GV: How would you respond to those who might consider a "black channel" exclusive? 
64458	CD: Take Elle, for example. 
64459	You open it, it's all white women. That doesn't bother me. But that's also why we've called the channel 'Nofi', because we wanted to get away from the message 'black and proud' — which I can see you could read as black, so not anyone else'. 
64460	With 'Nofi', we're in simpler territory, more effective, also gentler, and much more open. 
64461	If people think we're excluding them, that's because they want to exclude themselves. 
64462	Like, I dream of going to Japan, I love Japanese culture, and I don't feel excluded. 
64463	Japan isn't just for the Japanese. 
64464	GV: I think I've picked up that you're opening an office in Africa. 
64465	What's the objective for Nofi? 
64466	CD: We want to be more grounded, closer to where things are happening. 
64467	In France, the black community has one reality, with its issues and lifestyles. In Africa, there are other realities. 
64468	Today we can talk about certain things, but if you aren't living them day by day, it's not straightforward. 
64469	It's important to give a voice to people who can write, and who want to say and show things. Even if it's just the beauty of this amazing continent. 
64470	GV: Where would this office open? And when? 
64471	CD: Ideally it'll be in the Ivory Coast or perhaps Senegal. 
64472	Structurally, Ivory Coast would be better equipped for a launch. 
64473	There would be more obvious links with our office in Paris. 
64474	The opening should come in September this year. 
64475	GV: What topics work best on Nofi? 
64476	CD: What really works really well, hands down, is anything to do with history and culture. 
64477	People always want more. 
64478	There's a real thirst for learning and discovery. 
64479	We have an approach to news within the paradigm of African culture. 
64480	An example was when there was the furore over Antoine Griezmann and his 'blackface'. 
64481	We don't go in all guns blazing, but we do make it a solemn duty to explain what blackface is. 
64482	It's a necessary, real-life educative mission which allows people to grapple with the story better. 
64483	Another example, on a more positive note: we worked with Netflix on the new season of Luke Cage. 
64484	We went beyond celebrating the existence of a black superhero, to mount an exploration of all the codes in the show which recall blaxploitation, and the stake the black community has in segregation. 
64485	The feedback we got from Netflix is that it shed fresh light for them on their own show. 
64486	GV: Does the fact that you produce a lot of historical articles allow you to recreate the idea of a common cultural background within the community? 
64487	CD: Sure. 
64488	When you get to talking about segregation in the USA, all Blacks feel affected. Closely or at a distance. 
64489	And it's the same when you talk about the great figures of Africa: you're talking about one country but everyone still feels affected. 
64490	Or when you talk about a former slave who discovered the cultivation of vanilla on Réunion. 
64491	We all feel affected because we're talking about Blacks. 
64492	GV: Do you see things shifting in terms of representation in mainstream culture in France, whether in the media or in culture, films, TV shows? 
64493	CD: You can get the impression it's shifting, but in fact, as soon as there's a penetration of black culture into mainstream culture, I find it gets erased: it's replaced by words. 
64494	Generally we are more present, but not necessarily more represented. 
64495	And they're not the same. 
64496	We're not represented if the people presented don't have the right to express themselves in our name. 
64497	It's the same thing with enterprise: it's crazy the number of businesses set up by Blacks over the last five to 10 years! 
64498	It's great, and in sectors which go far beyond the clichés of music and sport. 
64499	But there's a kind of glass ceiling which erases everything when you reach a certain level, so that it stays white. 
64500	GV: What's the place of women in Nofi? 
64501	CD: The black woman has a central place in African culture. 
64502	In the Congo, some ethnic groups are culturally matriarchal. 
64503	That's important to us, and we promote many female and black heroines on the site. Whether they're from the past or contemporary. 
64504	Women who do things, who write books, who set up in business. 
64505	We always need to discover more about them. 
64506	GV: How do you envisage the future in 10 years' time? 
64507	CD: I want us to be unavoidable. 
64508	So we can offer an answer to this question of representation. 
64509	Because we're here, we exist, we're real and there's a need. 
64510	We must get beyond the times in the year when Blacks get talked about for the release of Black Panther 2. 
64511	We want to respond to the day-to-day, with an internet site, social networks, magazines, and -why not? — a TV station. A strong and powerful media group which will be a reflection of the community. 
64512	Crossing the Syrian-Turkish border: risks by the hour · Global Voices 
64513	Migrants in Hungary, August 2015.

64515	After the Assad regime forcibly moved residents of Eastern Ghouta to northern cities, some chose to stay within Syria's borders. But others chose to cross the border into Turkey and start a life far from war, bombs and death. 
64516	Of those, some planned to move further, toward cities in the European Union. 
64517	Omar (not his real name) was one of those who chose refuge in Turkey. 
64518	Instability, lack of security and the continuous fighting between the opposition factions, coupled with the lack of work opportunities or possibilities for higher education, pushed him to make such a decision. The 22-year-old arrived in Idlib, in northwestern Syria among the forcibly displaced masses from Eastern Ghouta. 
64519	Around two months after arriving in Idlib, Omar and a friend decided to seek a route into Turkey. 
64520	He consulted with a trafficker who had helped one of Omar's friends cross into Turkey a few days earlier. The trafficker told him to go to a district in Syria called Zarzour to negotiate the details and fees. 
64521	As they had been instructed, Omar and his friend met the trafficker at the designated location and the three agreed to cross the Turkish border that night. 
64522	The trafficker asked them to wait at a specified house, but he never showed up. 
64523	A few hours later, five people arrived at the house and said that the Gendarmerie (Turkish law enforcement) had caught them and ordered them to return to Syria. 
64524	They added that they were part of a bigger group that had been split into two. 
64525	The bigger group of eight had gone first and had been lucky to have crossed the border unnoticed. For this smaller group, it was the tenth unsuccessful attempt. 
64526	According to the story they related, their journey had started in a minivan that transported them to Adduriyah, an area adjacent to the border wall, accompanied by a guide, a person who knows the road well and communicates through a mobile phone with a monitor. 
64527	The monitor, in turn, monitors the movement of Turkish forces. The group was warned that the road was rugged and that they would have to jump over a wall and walk through sewers. 
64528	The journey was interrupted by Turkish forces. 
64529	Three members of that group decided not to take another chance and stayed in Syria. 
64530	The trafficker showed up the following day. 
64531	He asked Omar and his friend to each pay $450, the figure Omar had been given beforehand. 
64532	The trafficker told them to leave everything behind, including their luggage, as the journey would be rough. 
64533	Omar initially refused, but eventually caved in after the others who had experienced this journey told him that bags become an immense burden while crossing the border. The group that set out comprised four young men and two women. 
64534	They climbed a hill to the wall along the border. 
64535	After jumping over, the guide told them to run non-stop. 
64536	They had to pull along the women, for whom the exertion soon became too difficult. 
64537	The rough road was slick with mud, which made running more difficult as their feet got stuck in the wet earth. It was also strewn with thorns and flowing with dirty sewage water. 
64538	Just as they were on the verge of crossing the border, the two women could not take it anymore and began yelling and crying. 
64539	The yelling drew the attention of Turkish forces, who arrived on the scene and fired shots in the air. 
64540	The guide translated what the Turkish officers said. 
64541	The officers took them to a military enclosure with a watchtower, very bright searchlights and a helicopter landing pad. 
64542	The sat them down on the pad, along with another group that had been caught earlier. 
64543	A soldier took pictures of each of them with his mobile phone. Their names were taken and they were kept there until 3 a.m. 
64544	Every now and then they were joined by other groups of Syrians who had been caught by the Turkish forces — men and women, old and young. 
64545	At 3 a.m., in the freezing cold, the group boarded buses back to the official Turkish-Syrian crossing point —a bitter reminder of a time not so long ago when they had boarded the buses that had forcibly removed them from Eastern Ghouta to Idlib. 
64546	At the crossing point they were transported in minivans back to the trafficker's house, which was packed with Syrians waiting to escape the country. 
64547	There was barely space to sleep. 
64548	The loud cries of children coupled with the screams of men and women prevented Omar and his friend from getting much-needed rest. 
64549	The following day at noon, the trafficker told them they were to cross during the daytime. 
64550	As they approached the border area once more, they saw Turkish forces spread all along the border. 
64551	They flatly refused to attempt the crossing, and the trafficker then agreed to push the journey back to the evening. 
64552	At 8 p.m., the trafficker returned them to the same place at the border. 
64553	They waited in a grove of olive trees, 200 meters from the border, where many other groups of people were also waiting to make the crossing. 
64554	The guide went to scout the route and reported back that they would have to wait — until 5 a.m. 
64555	Trouble started brewing among the group, and people started yelling at the baffled guide, demanding that he take them back. 
64556	The guide called the trafficker and told him that the road was not clear, that Turkish forces were heavily present, and that they were firing shots in the air. 
64557	They waited there for one more hour and then returned to the trafficker's house. 
64558	Omar and his companions' morale plummetted. 
64559	They were tired, as they barely slept for three long nights. But they were determined to cross the border and decided to try another trafficker. 
64560	They got their money back and headed to Silkin, 30 kilometers away from Zarzour, where they waited for the new trafficker. 
64561	After a while, a young man of only 18 arrived and identified himself as the trafficker. 
64562	He took them to his house and explained the escape plan. 
64563	He said that the crossing would only take an hour and that the danger zone was no more than 200 meters. If they could cross this stretch, they would successfully reach Turkey. 
64564	The trafficker's family was very hospitable, his mother even prayed for them. 
64565	The trafficker charged them $400 each and like the previous trafficker, told them they could not take any belongings. 
64566	It was the first day of the holy month of Ramadan. 
64567	They washed up and set off on their journey before sunset. 
64568	The guide arrived and explained the route. 
64569	They were five people, split into two groups. 
64570	They first had to cross the Orontes River on a small float made of plastic bottles lashed together and stuffed into a cloth bag. 
64571	They waited for the calls for Maghreb prayer as Turkish soldiers would be busy breaking their fast and eating their Iftar meal, as the monitor had instructed the guide. 
64572	On the other bank spread fields of wheat. 
64573	The guide led them, crawling along the ground over mud and thorns for half an hour until they reached asphalt. 
64574	Then they sprinted over the 50-meter stretch between the asphalt road and the mountain. 
64575	They kept on running as the road continued up the mountain. 
64576	Half an hour later, the guide stopped and told them that they had just crossed the danger zone. 
64577	They caught their breath and marched their way to a Turkish village. They took shelter in a safe house, where they would wait for a car to collect them the next day. 
64578	They washed and slept in the safe house. 
64579	The following day, a Turkish man arrived and asked their destination — they said Istanbul. 
64580	He charged them $200. 
64581	The five men got into his car. 
64582	Twenty-six hours later, they arrived at their final destination. 
64583	Omar is now contemplating a plan to get to Europe. 
64584	Will he risk his life yet again in search of a better alternative to life in Syrian? 
64585	Meet Khazar Fatemi, a Swedish Journalist Still Searching for the Afghanistan She Left Behind · Global Voices 
64586	Screenshot from Where My Heart Beats. 
64587	Version uploaded to Vimeo by Khazar Fatemi. 
64588	At first glance, Khazar Fatemi, a leading TV reporter in Sweden, is as happy-go-lucky as she is talented and beautiful. 
64589	But personal sacrifice and struggle have deep roots in her family, and re-emerge with tremendous force in her documentary Where My Heart Beats, filmed in Afghanistan. 
64590	Fatemi was born in 1983. 
64591	Her family moved to Sweden when she was eight after her parents — both initially involved in the Kurdish resistance to the regime in Iran — fled growing violence in their adopted home of Afghanistan. 
64592	At the time, the mujaheddin had rolled back the Soviet invasion only to collapse into a spiral of internecine conflict. 
64593	Fatemi would later experience strong nostalgia for the Afghan capital Kabul, where she spent her childhood, as well as guilt that she, unlike many of her friends, had succeeded in escaping the country's bloody wars. 
64594	Where My Heart Beats tells the story of Fatemi's return to a very different Kabul through tears and laughter, with an authenticity that has already fetched the film international acclaim after it was presented at international festivals including IDFA and the Raindance Film Festival. 
64595	Her journey was both a reporter's journey — to see how the country had changed — and a personal journey, as she searched for people from her childhood. 
64596	However, the most important search of all, for her best friend, proved elusive. She never found out what had happened to her. 
64597	Global Voices recently met up with Fatemi, and engaged her in a conversation that touched on everything from the difficulties of life in Europe for people born in Muslim-Majority countries, through her childhood, and Afghanistan's turbulent past and present. 
64598	Nevena Borisova (NB): What is it like to be a modern woman whose identity is rooted in a strongly traditional society? 
64599	Khazar Fatemi (KF): The reason my family fled Iran during the 1980s was that they wanted to keep the freedom their parents have given to them, despite their own religious background My grandparents were Muslims but still believed that everyone has the right to make their own choice of life and beliefs. 
64600	So, for me it is important to use the freedom my parents fought so hard for, including against the regime, which left them with no choice but to leave their home. For 35 years they have not been able to go back. 
64601	The biggest challenge for me is not that I am coming from a traditional society. For me it has been Swedish society, which keeps questioning me because of my foreign name the way I look. 
64602	I have had to work ten times harder to prove myself, despite the fact that I know Swedish perfectly. 
64603	God knows what my mom has gone through because of her accent.

64605	NB: You explain in the documentary that during your team's travels around Kabul there were regular security precautions like bomb checks and so on. 
64606	How did you cope with the sense of fear? 
64607	The fear is always there, but one still can travel under control. 
64608	I have tried my best to work with people that have the knowledge of security but they also know the local society, culture, tradition and religion. 
64609	We tried not to leave the car unwatched and we also tried as often as we could to travel low key profile. 
64610	We did not stay too long and we even changed our car from day to day when it was possible. 
64611	At the same time, no one has ever taken so much care of me . 
64612	Even when I got sick, they treated me so well. I'm their guest, they kept saying. 
64613	NB: The way the documentary is shot makes it feel very authentic, with every emotion captured. 
64614	Can you tell us how you came up with the idea to make the documentary and how you went about it? 
64615	KF: When you make a documentary, you know what you want. 
64616	However, we never had a script, so we just let the camera roll and hoped for the best. 
64617	I kept asking myself what had happened to those who didn't have the chance to flee when the war came. 
64618	I wondered what had happened to my best friend Marim, to my teachers, to the baker in the neighborhood. 
64619	So, I had all these questions that I needed to find answers to. 
64620	Maybe I wanted to ease my own guilt which kept growing the older I got. 
64621	I had always known I would go back at any chance, so why not document it? So I talked to my media outlet and asked if I could borrow technical equipment. 
64622	I have learned that if you just listen to what people say, you will understand that they have amazing, heartbreaking, but inspiring and empowering stories to tell. 
64623	NB: From the documentary, it is clear that security and poverty have only gotten worse in Afghanistan in recent years. 
64624	But do you think the Afghan people have changed? Are they as resilient as ever? 
64625	KF: The worst was the hopelessness, especially among men. 
64626	Many times it felt that women were braver. 
64627	Many of them continue studying, even if they know that the society won’t let them in, when it comes to time to actually work. 
64628	The young men I talked with wanted to leave the country, they didn't see any future for themselves. 
64629	The elders keep living with the corrupt system and the so called “leaders” and foreigners only come to Afghanistan to serve their own interests. 
64630	This lack of trust and disappointment has grown every time I returned. 
64631	When I was there in 2008, Kabul was safe and we even traveled with a car on roads, whereas today it is totally impossible to travel. Now, even Kabul has become very unsafe. For me as a journalist it means it is more difficult to gain the trust of those I interview, to get close and to understand them. 
64632	The good thing is that I see how the young generation which got the chance to get an education has really done well. 
64633	One can find hope there, especially among young women, even though they are fighting two wars — one a physical war, with poverty and the insecurity, the other in terms of their own society, family, tradition, culture... 
64634	Screenshot from Where My Heart Beats. 
64635	Version uploaded to Vimeo by Khazar Fatemi. 
64636	NB: Did you ever feel targeted as a woman at certain moments making the documentary? 
64637	KF: I haven’t noticed this so much, because they still treated me as a foreigner. 
64638	But I can say that taking a walk around the neighborhood, going to the bazaar by myself, even if I almost managed to fit into the crowd, it would still have been much easier if I was a man. 
64639	I have also noticed that women didn’t feel comfortable to be interviewed in front of the camera. 
64640	Attitudes about women have only grown harder. 
64641	I think I got away with that, because I am regarded as a foreigner. 
64642	NB: Do you also feel nostalgic for Iran? What are your impressions on the current state of civil society there? 
64643	KF: No, I don’t have any nostalgia feeling, but would love to go back one day. 
64644	NB: Cheryl Benard, who has been a researcher at RAND corporation has suggested that Afghan youths, (rather than older generations of Afghans and young people from other countries) face a particular problem integrating into society following migration to Europe. 
64645	Is this fair to say? 
64646	KF: I don’t know about such a phenomenon, What I know from studies made here in Sweden is that Afghans are doing very well. They learn Swedish much faster than other groups. 
64647	Of course when maybe 80% of the youth that come here are from Afghanistan, that when crimes are committed by migrants, most of them turn out to be from Afghanistan. 
64648	But as I mentioned, we are talking about people who value education and have managed to learn the language and integrate into society faster than other groups, as one study I know has shown. 
64649	When will Egypt release photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid aka Shawkan? · Global Voices 
64650	Photo shared by the Freedom for Shawkan campaign on Facebook 
64651	In early September, when a Cairo Criminal Court handed a five-year jail sentence to photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, his supporters were relieved. 
64652	Mahmoud Abu Zeid, known online as Shawkan, was unlawfully detained and tried for photographing the 2013 bloody dispersal of the Rabaa El Adaweya sit-in, during which Egyptian security forces killed at least 817 people and injured many more. 
64653	Shawkan was working for Demotix at the time. 
64654	As the 31-year-old freelancer had already spent five years in jail awaiting trial, there was hope that he would not be made to serve additional time. 
64655	Yet today, more than one month after the Cairo court verdict, Shawkan remains in jail. 
64656	Shawkan was tried along with 739 other defendants in what is known as the “Rabaa Dispersal Case”. 
64657	He was arrested on August 14, 2013 as he was covering the sit-in, in which supporters of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi gathered to protest a military coup that ended his presidency on July 3 that same year. 
64658	Shawkan spent almost four years in pre-trial detention, in violation of Egyptian law which sets the maximum limit to two years. 
64659	On September 8, 2018, he was convicted on spurious charges of murder and affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, now designated as a terrorist group by the Egyptian government. 
64660	During the same trial, 75 prominent members and affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood were sentenced to death, and 47 other defendants were sentenced to life in prison. 
64661	Despite hopes that he was going to be freed soon, Shawkan's ordeal is yet to come to an end, and there has been no public explanation as to why Shawkan remains in jail to this date. 
64662	His supporters continue to demand his release. 
64663	#Egypt 🇪🇬: More than a month after an unfair verdict sentenced him to 5 years of prison already served, photojournalist 📷@ShawkanZeid remains behind bars. 
64664	He must be released immediately! #Freeshawkan #PressFreedom pic.twitter.com/zFDgSmps4s — IFJ (@IFJGlobal) October 11, 2018 
64665	In a statement released on October 11, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), called on Egyptian authorities to free Shawkan and denounced the trial's irregularities: 
64666	The first blow came when officials, officers, and soldiers had been excluded in the indictment or the formal statement of accusations, despite the hundreds of victims who fell on 14 August 2013, the day the sit-in was dispersed. 
64667	The second blow is that hundreds of defendants had already exceeded the maximum period of pretrial detention by law. 
64668	And finally, those who already served their full sentences are being deprived of the right to be released, in a blatant disregard of the judiciary decisions. 
64669	Shawkan's ordeal is similar to many others languishing in Egyptian prisoners. Those arrested on politically-motivated charges in Egypt are subjected to numerous violations including arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, prolonged pre-trial detention and solitary confinement. 
64670	On October 10, for the sixth year in a row, Shawkan celebrated his birthday in prison, when he turned 31. How many more birthdays will he have to celebrate behind bars?

64675	Journalists and media groups are opposing the new media guidelines issued by Tasmania's House of Assembly Speaker Sue Hickey. Tasmania is an island state of Australia located south of the country’s mainland. 
64676	The nine-page document dated August 2018 details what journalists are allowed and prohibited to do while reporting inside the House of Assembly and its precincts. 
64677	Media groups said the new rules undermine their work and make it almost impossible to report the proceedings in the Parliament. 
64678	Here are some of the rules that are being criticized: Journalists may not linger in the vicinity of the House of Assembly Chamber, Committee Rooms, the Atrium, Ministerial offices, party rooms or individual rooms of Members and may not seek to engage members in conversation. 
64679	As a general rule, members of the media wishing to speak with a Member should make an appointment by telephone. 
64680	Photographs of divisions, disturbances within the Chamber, or unparliamentary behavior by Members are not permitted. Photographs of individual Members, not speaking in debate, are not permitted. 
64681	Images cannot be digitally enhanced, touched up, or altered in any form. 
64682	Photographs taken are to be used only for the purpose of fair and accurate reports of proceedings and shall not be used for elections campaigns, satire or ridicule, and commercial advertising. 
64683	Photos are only permitted during the first 10 minutes of Question Time. 
64684	The Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance, the professional association for Australia’s journalists, described the new rules as “the most egregious attack on the work of a parliamentary press gallery.” 
64685	The guidelines represent an outrageous assault on press freedom, undermine the role of the media in carrying out legitimate scrutiny of the work of the state’s elected representatives, and hinder the dissemination of news and information to the people of Tasmania. 
64686	The Mercury, a newspaper in Tasmania, also rejected the new guidelines: 
64687	…these rules are nothing more than a sneaky way for our elected officials to avoid scrutiny as they go about the job taxpayers pay them to do in the building at the centre of our democratic system. 
64688	It plans to continue ‘lingering’ in the Parliament corridors despite the new rule banning it: 
64689	We therefore plan to continue to do so in the interests of open democracy and accountability. If the Speaker plans to enforce this ban, then that is a decision that would be on her head. 
64690	On Twitter, Australian quiz personality Brydon Coverdale questioned the rule which bans the taking of photos of 'unparliamentary behaviour' by parliamentarians. 
64691	Tasmania's parliament is banning the media from taking "photos of 'unparliamentary behaviour' by parliamentarians." 
64692	Who do these politicians think they are? They are elected by the public, and the public is absolutely entitled to see how they behave. https://t.co/G4jDSqMZW8 — Brydon Coverdale (@brydoncoverdale) October 18, 2018 
64693	Speaker Hickey insisted that the guidelines her office issued are not really new and that they reflect the standard in other state parliaments. Some parliamentarians are also reportedly not happy that reporters can easily interview them in the chamber. But Hickey acknowledged the criticism against the new guidelines and vowed to consult the media about it. 
64694	Meanwhile, some journalists took photos of themselves ‘lingering’ in the Parliament corridor which is not allowed in the guidelines.

64709	'In a lot of the post-colonial world, so much of what really drives us is suppressed' · Global Voices 
64710	Ghanaian born, South Africa-based architect, novelist and educator Lesley Lokko, during her visit to Trinidad, June 2018. Photo by Mark Raymond, used with permission. 
64711	This is the second instalment in our interview series with Professor Lesley Lokko, head of the Graduate School of Architecture at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa. 
64712	You can read the first post here. 
64713	When you think of the role of an architect in society, you might think about the importance of creating a physical environment that's a snapshot of human civilisation. 
64714	Or about organising space based on needs, aspirations and hopes of a particular culture. 
64715	But in societies like the Caribbean, not everyone uses an architect's services — often to their detriment. Why? Lesley Lokko, an architect and writer who recently visited Trinidad and Tobago on the invitation of the Trinidad and Tobago Institute of Architects and Bocas Lit Fest, has an idea. 
64716	She thinks this might have something to do with how people perceive the purpose of an architect. 
64717	Many people do not realise that purpose extends way beyond design and plans — it is connected to a great many other things, including technology and human relationships. 
64718	Global Voices (GV): So what is the role of an architect in modern-day society? 
64719	Lesley Lokko (LL): I’m always drawn to Spain as a model because I believe it takes in more architecture students per capita than any other country. 
64720	However, although record numbers of people study architecture there, Spain graduates the smallest number — in relation to the number that its schools take in — who go on to work as practising architects. 
64721	So architecture is seen as a really interesting, fundamental degree, and even if people go through the full five years, they often go into many other fields that may have something to do with the built environment but not necessarily architecture or design. 
64722	The mayor of a small village, for instance, might have studied architecture and therefore understands the power and value of a really good piece of civic architecture — so big cities like Madrid and Barcelona are not the only places where projects are happening. 
64723	Spain is quite democratic in the way in which good architecture or civic space is commissioned. 
64724	In the post-colonial world, there's an insecurity around our relationship with education and training that’s just part and parcel of our thinking — so, the attitude generally is, if you start studying architecture, by God you’re going to finish, and then work for a big practice, earn a good living and so on, which perpetuates the idea that architecture is a professional discipline for those who can afford it. 
64725	I think that’s the complete wrong way to think about it. I run an architecture school now in Johannesburg. 
64726	It’s the biggest postgraduate school in South Africa, we are now into our third cycle of graduates, and it’s been quite a radical curriculum change. 
64727	We’ve got graduates now who go off into multimedia, theatre design, web design...things that are sort of spatial, alternative forms of practice. 
64728	Architecture is a much more lateral, broader, much more diffuse discipline than the way it has conventionally been taught. 
64729	To make the point more clearly, unlike medical students, for example, who practice on the body of a patient; unlike lawyers, who train with language and rhetoric, students of architecture never build buildings — only representations of them. 
64730	Students of Johannesburg's Graduate School of Architecture during the school's 2017 Summer Show. Photo courtesy Lesley Lokko, used with permission. 
64731	Lesley Lokko (LL): Representation, in effect, is almost its own discipline. 
64732	It’s their language, whether that’s in film, multimedia, photography, collage, montage — the range of visual tools available to students today is almost endless. 
64733	The historical tools — plans, sections, and elevations — are absolutely vital in terms of instructing someone how to build. 
64734	But they’re not the only means by which a project can be drawn or represented. 
64735	To add to the complexity, modern construction methods are their own speciality. 
64736	If you were to look at the façade of a building today, even as an architect at the top of your game, you’d be hard-pressed to explain how it ‘works’. 
64737	But just because something is new or modern doesn’t mean it’s without complications and challenges. 
64738	Where new means of communication have been very successful — and it goes back to this issue of social media — is in disguising themselves in the language of the old. 
64739	Facebook uses terms like “Like” and “Friend” — but you are not my friend in the conventional sense of the word. 
64740	Young people today have less and less sense of the conventional or traditional meaning of words and as a result, their understanding of the world has shifted. 
64741	When I talk to my students about things like scale and distance and proximity and adjacency, all the architectural terms of my own training, they understand them completely differently. 
64742	Distance means little to them because they can be friends with someone they've never actually seen who’s 6,000 miles away. 
64743	They’re used to seeing things on a screen, not in three-dimensions. 
64744	Their worlds are networked, fluid, mobile, where mine was fixed, grounded, solid. 
64745	And these terms are still the fundamental terms of our trade. 
64746	You have to be able to understand things in scale, but if you don’t understand what scale is, because your world has no scale… We’re being altered, somehow slowly, without us even noticing it. 
64747	Students of Johannesburg's Graduate School of Architecture during the school's 2017 Summer Show. Photo courtesy Lesley Lokko, used with permission. 
64748	GV: How does that affect how you teach the discipline? 
64749	LL: The one luxury of education is that it gives you time and freedom to reflect...very different from when you have deadlines and budgets. 
64750	But I find that very few people are talking really about those things, certainly in Africa. 
64751	We’re still talking about productivity and efficiency and employability and test results — we’re not really talking about the deep things that I think matter. 
64752	We operate at such a speed now that those opportunities to reflect critically on what’s happening to us in scale and time and distance and taste are important. 
64753	GV: So how does architecture host that relationship between people and environment in a world where technology is such an influence and is changing so fast? 
64754	LL: I travel a lot. 
64755	So when I was packing for this trip , I left Joburg, went to Paris, Venice, London, Miami, Santo Domingo, here, going to Chicago, back to London, then to Madrid and then I go home. 
64756	Everything fits in a fairly small suitcase because I know most of the hotels I stay at I can launder a clean shirt; I stick to a palate of mostly black and white because that’ll go everywhere; my clothes are neither too heavy nor too light — so in a sense, my environment is elastic — it’s moving with me. 
64757	And I'd put on Instagram that I’ve been to Santo Domingo, I’ve been to Trinidad, but I could just as easily cut and paste those images from the internet and no one would ever know. 
64758	So in a weird way, it’s strange to me that I’m going to travel halfway round the world, but at another level, it’s almost as if I didn’t go. 
64759	In that construct, my relationships with people become really important. 
64760	So it’s less my relationship with the environment or even the architecture. 
64761	I’m looking for more meaningful connections with people that I meet. 
64762	We run a very different programme in the graduate school which involves what’s sometimes referred to as ‘cracking’ students open. 
64763	In a less brutal sense, I’m really interested in what drives them. 
64764	In a post-colonial context, the majority of students are black — and for me, it’s not so much a skin colour as the fact that they come with emotional relationships to the rest of the world that are different from the white students — through things like history, class, privilege, etc. 
64765	I don’t want those students to miss the opportunity of being honest. 
64766	So students need to tell me what really drives them, what they are really interested in, and I will find a way to facilitate that interest. 
64767	In a lot of the post-colonial world, I would argue that what’s required is a kind of creative therapy because so much of what really drives us is suppressed. The cover of one of Lesley Lokko's novels. Image courtesy Lokko, used with permission. 
64768	GV: What about synergies between writing and architecture? 
64769	LL: Architects are narrators. 
64770	They tell a story through the way in which they manipulate space. 
64771	That story might be subliminal, but all architecture is storytelling — even more so at the level of student architecture, because you don’t build the building, so whatever representation of it that you have is its own narrative. 
64772	For me, writing — because architecture was so resistant to these issues around race, identity, gender, power — writing was actually an easy discipline to deal with because it’s more forgiving. 
64773	If you think about English literature as a body, it has been so enriched by the post-colonial world. 
64774	You can’t really think of English literature without that influence — it’s impossible. 
64775	Architecture is different. 
64776	It’s historically been really resistant to the idea of ‘difference’ — perhaps less so now than 30 years ago — but when I was studying, if you wanted to talk about race or identity, people would say, ‘Go study sociology, not architecture!’ 
64777	But I don’t see them as different at all. 
64778	Someone once suggested to me that I must have an affinity for situations that are neither one thing nor the other and that is connected to childhood. 
64779	Being half-Scottish, half-Ghanaian, there was a comfort in things that can’t quite be reconciled. 
64780	When I finished studying sociology, I decided I wanted to be an architect and then I wanted to be a writer, so there’s always been an instinct to move out of something just because I like that tension. 
64781	And probably now, after so long, I understand that tension is productive. 
64782	It’s not problematic. 
64783	But the same impetus is there to tell a story. 
64784	GV: You've turned that tension into a tool. 
64785	LL: Yes, and I use it in writing and in teaching. 
64786	To me, my novels were always didactic — all about crossing racial barriers and political histories — and half of the people reading would think it’s a love story. 
64787	I realised that what you think you’re doing and what other people read into it...you’ve got no control over that. 
64788	And I think it’s the same in teaching now — there’s a lot I want to say and I’m saying it through students’ work. 
64789	And in much the same way that the books go off and do their own thing, so do the students and that’s really satisfying, that there are no conclusions. 
64790	In the third and final instalment in this series, we talk about literature, culture and identity. 
64791	Political cartoonist Badiucao abruptly cancelled his Hong Kong exhibition — and then went silent · Global Voices 
64792	“Gongle,” by Badiucao, is a play on words commenting on Google’s effort to re-enter China with a censored search engine. 
64793	Used with permission. 
64794	Political cartoonist Badiucao was forced to cancel his first solo exhibition in Hong Kong, due to threats from the central Chinese government. 
64795	The exhibition was scheduled to open on November 3 as the headline event at Hong Kong's Free Expression Week. On November 2, the organizers announced they were cancelling the event: 
64796	We are sorry to announce that the exhibition “Gongle,” by Chinese artist Badiucao, has been cancelled due to safety concerns. 
64797	The decision follows threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist. Whilst the organisers value freedom of expression, the safety of our partners remains a major concern. 
64798	Badiucao has built his reputation on Twitter, drawing political cartoons that challenge censorship and dictatorship in China. The Chinese-Australian artist's work has been featured by The New York Times and The Guardian. 
64799	The event was seen by many as a test of the limits of free speech in Hong Kong, which enjoys more freedoms than mainland China, under a principle known as “One Country, Two Systems.” In recent years, Beijing has more forcefully asserted its influence over Hong Kong. 
64800	Those who support more democratic rights, such as genuine universal suffrage, or outright independence, have faced fierce repression. 
64801	The organizers have not described the nature of the threats that the artist received. He is typically outspoken online, but has not updated his Twitter since November 1. 
64802	Badiucao had not intended to travel to Hong Kong, but was supposed to participate in a panel discussion via video call with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong, Hong Kong artists Sampson Wong and Oscar Ho, and Russian punk-rock protesters Olga Kuracheva and Veronika Nikulshina, both members of the band Pussy Riot. 
64803	Although the exhibition was cancelled, the panelists decided to proceed and hold a discussion about art and freedom of expression in a small studio. They live-streamed the event on Facebook.

64806	Chinese non-profit media the Stand News reported on the panel discussion in which Sampson Wong expressed concerns about Badiucao’s safety. 
64807	He explained that he has been trying to contact the artist since November 2, but that Badiucao has been incommunicado. Wong saw the exhibition as a test case for freedom of expression in Hong Kong. 
64808	He pointed out that Beijing’s censorship practices in Hong Kong are unclear. There is a general expectation that Hong Kongers "should know" where the red line lies, but there are relatively few clear indications of what is and is not permissible. 
64809	He expressed a desire for people to be more creative in fighting against censorship. 
64810	Joshua Wong said he wanted more exchange with international civil society, in hopes that international networks could help local groups defend democracy and freedom. 
64811	Pussy Riot member Olga Kuracheva emphasized the importance of public support and solidarity for people like Badiucao: 
64812	We are very sorry to know that things are getting worse here. I think it is very important to be here now just to express our solidarity... 
64813	I would advise people not to be afraid, because one voice is not so much…but voices of solidarity should sound loud. 
64814	(Quote from Hong Kong Free Press’ report) 
64815	Kuracheva and Nikulshina are among four members of Pussy Riot who served a 15-day jail sentence after protesting against Russian leader Vladimir Putin during the football World Cup final in Moscow in July 2018. They said threats to exhibitions and political art events are “common practice” in Russia. 
64816	Cedric Alviani from Reporters Without Borders pointed out that Hong Kong’s ranking on RSF's press freedom index has dropped from 18 in 2002 to 70 in 2018. He believed that the best way to support artists under threat is to disseminate their works in spaces where it is possible to do so.

64821	Colombia is experiencing a spike in violence since President Juan Manuel Santos signed a historic peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with one person being killed every four days since 2016. 
64822	As the FARC demobilizes in the countryside, it also opens a vacuum for other groups — including other guerrilla, successors of right-wing paramilitary groups, and dissidents of the FARC itself — to fight for control over the abandoned lands. In turn, community leaders and activists are caught in the crossfire and the government has been slow to address the problem. 
64823	While solutions eludes the government, activists are setting up initiatives to preserve the memories of the victims. Among them is "Postales para la memoria" (postcards for memory), a collaborative project in which volunteer illustrators and writers draw portraits or write short biographies of the assassinated activists. 
64824	For the project's creators, the victims' stories end up lost in the background of the media's coverage of the peace process. The website says:

64848	In Mexico, alarming security issues are nothing new — press reports, statistics and general public perception all point to a rise in criminal offenses. 
64849	Faced with this situation, which has at times exceeded the scope of the public institutions meant to deal with it, regular citizens in Mexico City have turned to mapping technology in an effort to reduce the impact of crime in their communities. 
64850	According to a report on criminal offenses in the capital, in the second quarter of 2018, Mexico City suffered from the second highest incidents of violent robbery in the nation. It also ranked third out of 32 states for street robberies and tenth for burglary. 
64851	These statistics translate to an astounding 96 violent robberies, 27 vehicle thefts, 20 burglaries, 44 business robberies and 40 robberies per day. 
64852	In response to this rise in crime, a group of community members from Anáhuac in Mexico City has created a public Google map where people can record the exact spots where crimes have taken place. The goal of the map is to record and to prevent robberies and vehicle theft. 
64853	Users can also leave details about the crimes and help civil organizations with the collection of statistics. 
64854	The data is based on reports by either witnesses or victims themselves. Some of the reports seen in the map have been previously reported to the corresponding authorities as well. 
64855	The link to the map is shared on Twitter, where community members can also ask questions and discuss the ongoing urban violence: 
64856	Neighbors, don't forget to check the crime map of the June. If your report is not there, let us know. 
64857	The strategy of using geographic location apps as a tool to combat crime is not a new phenomenon. From 2013 to 2016, the website Hoyo de Crimen (Hole of Crime) gathered information about all types of crime per city block. 
64858	Data on criminal incidents was obtained through information requests from the Mexican capital's security services. This particular project included recorded events such as assaults, vehicle theft, and homicides, among others. 
64859	The project was created by programmer Diego Valles, who comments on a post written on u-GOB that his project can help people avoid danger in the city: 
64860	With this data and its visualization, citizens and authorities can know where the most violent areas are located; entrepreneurs would choose where to locate their businesses in a better way, and drivers would know which parking lots should be steered clear of. 
64861	Hoyo de Crimen stresses that the project also sought to "ask for accounts from police officers and commanders responsible for each area." 
64862	Despite the relevance of such a project, Hoyo de Crimen was ultimately forced to stop updating information after authorities refused to provide necessary data and disseminate official information. 
64863	Maps for every kind of crime 
64864	Geography students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), have also adopted the map initiative to follow and denounce crime inside the campus. The data is collected through an anonymous online survey which is shared publicly on Facebook. In a post on Facebook, one student explains that the survey and the map aim to "show the spaces taken over by violence in the university campus". 
64865	The post also makes reference to student shock groups, also known as porros, who have been the at the center of allegations of violence inside pacific protests for years at UNAM. 
64866	Screenshot of the map made and shared by the students. The map is shared on PDF format publicly through the students' Facebook accounts. 
64867	Architecture students in the same university have also drawn up a map to locate assaults, harassment allegations and other acts of violence happening inside the campus. The group shares information on Facebook and Instagram:

64871	Since 2016, a female developer working under a pseudonym for her own safety has produced an interactive map of femicides in the whole country. 
64872	The development and spread of mapping technologies have proven to be an important tool to combat crime and, more importantly, to create a self-reliant community which aims to collect data provided by users themselves.

64874	Interview with Rosaly Lopes, a Brazilian NASA astronomer and the first woman to edit the journal founded by Carl Sagan · Global Voices 
64875	Dr. Rosaly Lopes | Foto: Divulgação, used with permission. 
64876	Rosaly Lopes grew up in a middle-class family in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil watching Star Trek, fascinated by her school’s telescope and following all the news about the Apollo mission. When Apollo 13 had to return to Earth in April 1970, it was the story of Francis Northcutt, the woman responsible for calculating the spaceship's route home, that grabbed her attention. 
64877	“Just showing a woman, in Houston’s control centre, was a very great inspiration for me,” Lopes said in a telephone interview with Global Voices (GV). 
64878	Forty-eight years after the mission, Rosaly Lopes has become one of the world’s most important scientists. Director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) department of planetary sciences, she entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 2006 for having discovered the most volcanos, recording 71 on Jupiter’s moon while working on the Galileo mission. 
64879	Since 2002, Lopes is among those in charge of exploring Saturn’s moon Titan, the second largest in the solar system, with the probe Cassini. It is on Titan that she will begin searching for the possibility of life outside of Earth. 
64880	Created by the famous astronomer Carl Sagan, the journal is a reference point in planetary sciences. She spoke with GV about her projects and the power of seeing women in important roles in science to help future generations. 
64881	GV: How did you become the first woman to edit the journal Icarus? 
64882	Rosaly Lopes (RL): Carl Sagan started Icarus because at the time there was no scientific journal to publish works exclusively on planetary science. The editors all came from Cornell University because at the time the submissions were all sent there and passed from one professor to another. 
64883	I presented myself as a candidate and they chose me. GV: What do you think of the ideas that question scientific data, facts, and research? 
64884	RL: It is a small part of the population which think this. But there are people who do not want to believe that it is human activity which is causing . This is because there are a lot of people who are afraid that our mode of life has to change. 
64885	I am optimistic, I think that we will discover ways of using energy that do not cause global warming. The problem is that the question has become more political than scientific. 
64886	Photo: personal archive, published with permission. GV: In 2005, you received the Carl Sagan medal for your work on inclusiveness in public education, especially for Hispanic youths and women. Could you speak more about your view on this? 
64887	RL: Inclusion is important because science needs talent, it needs dedicated people, and it does not matter it they are men or women, of different ethnicities, or anything. 
64888	It is important to have youths aimed at a career in sciences and technology because it is our future. 
64889	Medicine is also very linked to the area of technology. Science has to be a field prepared to include all. 
64890	GV: For women, they say that the atmosphere in the field of science is more difficult, that they need to prove themselves more. Do you agree? 
64891	I think that 50 or 30 years ago, yes. But, today, for example, in the area of Planetary Sciences, women constitute 30 or 35 percent. 
64892	Now seeing a woman scientist is not a thing that people consider 'different'. From the moment that you have 25 percent women in a scientific area, it starts to be something more normal. 
64893	GV: Did you ever encounter prejudice? 
64894	RL: No and I never worried much about this. People should not lose time worrying about this. I was always of the opinion that, if somebody has a prejudice, the problem is theirs, not mine. It is better to go forwards and do the work in the best way that you can. 
64895	GV: How did you start taking an interest in this area? 
64896	RL: I grew up with the Apollo programme and it was that which inspired me a lot. I wanted to be an astronaut, at first, but I saw that I was a woman, Brazilian, and very short-sighted. So, really, it was not going to happen. 
64897	GV: What did your parents think? 
64898	RL: Fortunately, they supported me a lot, because without this I could not have taken on anything. My mother was worried that I, as an astronomer, would not have a job. But she made a point of me learning English and French, for me to have a way of earning money, even if the profession did not give me money. They encouraged me a lot such that I studied abroad, they paid for everything, made sacrifices, because they saw that, especially at that time, there was no field of astronomy in Brazil. 
64899	Now it is better. GV: Is it common to see people from developing countries in this field? RL: It is not very common, but it is changing. 
64900	There are opportunities, especially if you are very dedicated and study a lot. We need talents working in those areas, so it is important to encourage all the people who really like the field. 
64901	GV: A Brazilian magazine referred to you as 'the Brazilian who succeeded at NASA'. What do you think of that title? 
64902	My preparation in Brazil was lower than the British students, although I had attended good schools. Afterwards, I was in Britain with a good job with the government, I worked at Greenwich Observatory, but decided that it was not what I wanted to do, because there was no chance of doing research. 
64903	I took a risk, left the job and went to the USA to participate in JPL with NASA, with a scholarship for two years’ duration. 
64904	Fortunately, it worked out, but it was a risk, because I knew what I wanted. My father said that the most important thing life was to have a passion, go after it and don’t give up. 
64905	GV: You participated in the Cassini Mission and became one of the world’s leading specialists in active volcanoes. Which of your projects did you most like doing? 
64906	RL: That is difficult to know. I think that my work on the Galileo Mission, on the volcanic moons of Jupiter, was what most stands out even today. But, I hope that my most important work, I have not done it yet. That I still have time ahead. 
64907	Photo: Rosaly Lopes from her personal archive, published with permission. 
64908	GV: What is your next project? 
64909	RL: I just received funding from NASA, a large project of mine was approved to study the moon Titan in more depth, which is a moon of Saturn. We want to do this study with a lot of researchers, spread over all the United States, in Hawaii, Chicago, Britain. 
64910	We are conducting a study on the possibility of life developing on Titan. 
64911	GV: Do you think that we are close to the day when we can live outside of Earth? 
64912	RL: This is what we are going to study, not only the biological aspect, which already has a team of biologists in Chicago researching if life could develop in the ocean of liquid water underneath a layer of ice on Titan, but if organic material, which could serve as food for that life, that we know exists in the atmosphere and on the surface, could penetrate the ocean and after, with cryovolcnanism, ice-volcanic activity, if it could come to the surface and we could detect those signs of life. 
64913	GV: But do you think that we are close to the day when we could live in those environments? 
64914	RL: I am talking about the possibilities of microscopic life, which is one of the fundamental questions to know if life developed in other planets and moons. The possibility of colonization, there are now plans to make a base on the Moon, but I think that will take a long time. If I have an opportunity to go to Space, I will go. My dream of being an astronaut is still there. 
64915	GV: Icarus was created by Carl Sagan and he was the editor of it for some time. Did he become one of your references? 
64916	RL: I knew Carl Sagan personally, because when I worked on the Galileo Mission, he was also working on it. He did very important things, not only for the field of sciences, but for having been the first scientist who stood out for publicizing sciences in a big way. At the time that he started doing this, with TV programmes and everything else, the majority of scientists thought that it was not a good thing. 
64917	There are still people who have prejudices, but it is reducing. GV: Cosmos is still a reference for a lot of people. RL: It is. 
64918	Her nickname was Poppy. She worked for a company for an airspace company, calculating orbits for spaceships and she had been helping the calculations for Apollo 13 to return. Just showing a woman, in the Houston control centre, was a very big inspiration for me.

64920	Alaa And El Fattah, photo by Nariman El-Mofty. 
64921	After spending five years in prison, Egyptian blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is scheduled to be released from prison on March 17, 2019. On December 8, his family launched a campaign — "100 days for Alaa" — to ensure his prison term ends on time. 
64922	The March release date does not mark the end of Alaa's time served, but rather a transition to the final phase of his sentence. After his release, Alaa will be made to spend every night in his local police station for an additional five years. He will be under police surveillance throughout this period. 
64923	Alaa was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November 2013. More than one year later, in February 2015, he was finally tried and sentenced to five years in prison for "organising" a protest under a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorised demonstrations. 
64924	While he did take part in a protest against military trials for civilians on 26 November 2013, Alaa had no role in organising it. His sentence was confirmed by Egypt’s Court of Cassation in November 2017. 
64925	Omar Robert Hamilton, a cousin of Alaa, outlined the goals of the campaign on Twitter: 
64926	To re-focus local and international attention on his case to ensure that Alaa is actually released on March 17th. 
64927	To enter the concept of المراقبة ('surveillance' or 'parole') into the public consciousness. 
64928	After release, Alaa is still sentenced to spend every night in his local police station for *five years*. 
64929	We need to lay the groundwork for pressure against this. 
64930	Alaa has been jailed or investigated under every Egyptian head of state who has served during his lifetime. 
64931	In 2006, he was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest. 
64932	In 2011, he spent two months in prison, missing the birth of his first child, Khaled. 
64933	In 2013, he was arrested and detained for 115 days without trial. Alaa has long worked on technology and political activism projects with his wife, Manal Hassan. 
64934	He comes from a family of prominent human rights advocates, including human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El Islam, Alaa's father, who was jailed multiple times under the regime of Hosni Mubarak. 
64935	Abd El Fattah’s sisters, Mona and Sanaa Seif, are also human rights defenders who have long campaigned against the military trials of civilians in the country. 
64936	In 2016, Sanaa served a six-month jail sentence for insulting a public official. 
64937	Alaa's ordeal is similar to many other Egyptians who are behind bars because of their activism. 
64938	There are as many as 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt, human rights groups say. Those arrested on politically-motivated charges in Egypt are often subjected to enforced disappearances, torture, prolonged pre-trial detention and solitary confinement. 
64939	Joining the #FreeAlaa campaign 
64940	In a letter to the attendees of RightsCon, a digital rights conference held in Toronto in May 2018, Alaa urged supporters to "fix own democracies". 
64941	This has always been my answer to the question “how can we help?” I still believe is the only possible answer. 
64942	Not only is where you live, work, vote, pay tax and organize the place where you have more influence, but a setback for human rights in a place where democracy has deep roots is certain to be used as an excuse for even worse violations in societies where rights are more fragile. 
64943	I trust recent events made it evident that there is much that needs fixing. 
64944	I look forward to being inspired by how you go about fixing it. 
64945	Those looking to join the "100 days for Alaa" campaign are encouraged to send "essays, photos or acts of solidarity" that will be republished on the campaign's website: 
64946	This is an open-source campaign - we'll be putting out some new ideas, but need new thoughts and new energy coming in too. 
64947	So get thinking with us! 
64948	The hashtag, as always, is #FreeAlaa - please join us in preparing the ground for Alaa's release.

64951	It is a historic day: that is how many Mozambicans regard December 14, 2018 when, for the first time in the country's civil aviation history, an airplane was operated solely by women. 
64952	The crew for flight TM112/3, which traveled between the capital, Maputo, and Manica — an air distance of 442 miles — was captain Admira António, co-pilot Elsa Balate, cabin chief Maria da Luz Aurélio, and flight attendant Débora Madeleine.

64962	Social activist Mauro Brito added that women should be proud "when are represented in various sectors": 
64963	In aviation there are few women, very few, this is not only here but in the whole world. 
64964	I imagine the women who thought this profession was for men only, should feel proud. 
64965	Mozambique is not alone. In August 2018, in a first for South Africa's national carrier SAA, an intercontinental flight with an all-female crew took to the skies to transport passengers from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo, Brazil.

64970	Text and video by Lilit Mkhitaryan. 
64971	Lernagyugh, an Armenian village 150 kilometers from capital Yerevan, is dying. 
64972	While it was once a robust community, just four people remain there today. 
64973	The village is remote, closed off from the rest of the country during the winter, and it lacks even basic services, like schools. 
64974	The situation has become so dire that Nikol Martirosyan, 60, and his wife Haykush Nikoghosyan – one of the two remaining families in the village – are thinking of leaving. 
64975	Hrant Minasyan and his wife Margarit Kchoyan, the other remaining family, have lived in the village for 30 years. 
64976	Hrant is 62 and has little hope that his family will remain in Lernagyugh after he dies: one of his two sons works abroad and the second has already resettled in a different village. 
64977	It’s official: 2018 in Japan was a ‘disaster’ · Global Voices 
64978	After a year of earthquakes, torrential rains, floods, typhoons and torrid heat, the Chinese character meaning "disaster" ( 災: "wazawai" or "sai") was named as Japan's "2018 Kanji of the Year". 
64979	Chinese characters are known as kanji (漢字) in Japan. 
64980	This year's kanji was selected by the Japanese Kanji Proficiency Society based on the results of a nationwide poll conducted earlier in the fall. 
64981	Of the 193,214 entries submitted from all Japan, "wazawai" received the most ballots at 20,858. 
64982	Throughout 2018, Japan endured a steady series of hammer blows, including: A massive snowfall that all but shut down towns along the Japan Sea coast for nearly a week An earthquake in June that seriously damaged some parts of Osaka and neighboring cities Widespread deadly flooding in July after much of western Japan received incredible amounts of torrential rain that broke all historical records Record-breaking heat for much of the summer that resulted in thousands of deaths Another earthquake in September, this time in southern Hokkaido, that left millions without power for up to three days and disrupted the economy of the island The strongest typhoon in 25 years, which shut down Osaka's main international airport for nearly a week 
64983	In a news release, the Kyoto-based Japanese Kanji Proficiency Society explained that “disaster” was a suitable symbol for 2018 in Japan because the kanji character touched people's lives in different ways: 
64984	Since, all over Japan, no one knew when calamity (災害) might strike, the number of people who decided to take personal responsibility for disaster preparedness (防災) increased. And since no one could forget the calamities that afflicted Japan, it was a year when many wanted to learn more about how to reduce the effects of natural disasters (減災). 
64985	Each December, the Kanji of the Year is announced at historic Kiyomizu-dera, a temple and UNESCO world heritage site in Kyoto, first established 1,300 years ago. Reverend Mori Seihan, the chief abbot of the temple, typically unveils the Kanji of the Year by writing it in traditional calligraphy, captured in this video of the 2018 ceremony: 
64986	As Japan prepares for the abdication of its current emperor in May 2019, thereby ending the Heisei Era as it makes the transition to a new emperor, the second most popular Chinese character in this year's poll was "hei" (平). "Hei" is one of two kanji that make up "Heisei" (平成), the name of the reign of the current Emperor of Japan, who is typically known in the rest of the world as Akihito: While the most popular character was "wazawai", number-two was "hei" (平) with some commentators stating it is the end of the Heisei (平成) Era in Japan. 
64987	For many others, the 2018 PyeongChang (written as 平昌 in Japanese) Olympics and the 2018 US-Korea summit that sought peace (平和) were positive aspects of the past years. 😊 We hope that the next year will be one for which a positive and bright kanji character can be chosen. ✨ — 2018 Kanji of the Year. 
64988	Mozambique’s new China-funded Maputo-KaTembe bridge, the longest in Africa, comes with high tolls · Global Voices 
64989	The Maputo-KaTembe bridge. 
64990	Photo by Alexandre Nhampossa, used with permission. 
64991	It's the largest suspension bridge in Africa and one of the 60 longest in the world, as well as a symbol of Chinese investment in Mozambique. The bridge was built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation at a cost of 785 million US dollars, making it the most expensive infrastructure project undertaken in Mozambique since the country's independence in 1975. 
64992	It was 95 percent funded by loans from China's EXIM bank, to be paid by the Mozambique state in 20 years time at a four percent interest (the remaining five percent came directly from the public coffers). 
64993	The construction affected around 900 families, who had to be rehoused. 
64994	Authorities say the relocation process contributed to delaying the bridge's inauguration, originally scheduled for June 25, the date Mozambique celebrates its independence. 
64995	The government hopes that the Bridge will serve the hundreds of residents of the KaTembe district who commute by small boats and ferry boats to the center of Maputo for work and study. 
64996	KaTembe is officially part of the metropolitan area of Maputo, but both regions are very different: the northern half of Maputo is a highly-urbanized center, with a population of around two million, while KaTembe lacks infrastructure and still has plenty of unused lands. 
64997	Authorities also hope to boost trade and tourism from South Africa — the driving time between its east coast border and Maputo will now take around 90 minutes instead of the previous six hours. 
64998	The bridge, which has no pedestrian lane, will be tolled from 160 to 1200 Meticais (2.60 to 20 USD). Frequent users will have an up to 75 percent discount. Currently, boat-crossing of Maputo costs between 10 and 1050 meticais (0.16 and 17.24 USD).

65001	However, the bridge has faced criticism from Mozambicans for the high costs of the loans that permitted its construction — as well as the toll charges that will help service them. 
65002	University student Sérgio Wiliamo said on Facebook: 
65003	There is here a failure of the government when determining such fees. In projects like those, the fees do not aim to recover the initial investment, but to upkeep the infrastructure. 
65004	It seems to me, and taking into account the high values I have seen, there are gains that are expected to be obtained above the simple operationalization and maintenance of the infrastructure 
65005	Also commenting on the fees, philosopher and professor of Eduardo Mondlane University, Ergimino Mucale, wrote on Facebook: The essence of a bridge is to connect, to unify, to (re-)establish contact. 
65006	Mozambique is now the first country in history to distort the traditional meaning of the concept of the bridge. The beautiful and one of the largest suspended bridges of Africa, Maputo-KaTembe, was born to establish or unveil, painfully, the gap between the wealthy and the wretched of one same nation. It is no longer the few miles separating the Maputo residents from here and there, but the many meticais of the coming tolls.

65009	A contributor of World Vision, a development organization, Elvino Dias expects the bridge to be a relief for the citizens of KaTembe, but also has reservations regarding the toll: 
65010	When we applauded that the Maputo KaTembe Bridge marked the end of the suffering of the citizens of that part of Maputo, I didn't imagine that it would be the beginning of another form of slavery, and this time without an end in sight. 
65011	I do not care where the money came for the construction of the bridge or road came from, because I know I've paid taxes that supposedly were for building such infrastructures. That's why I sometimes wonder where taxpayer's money goes to. 
65012	Dear brothers, if they persist with such prices, we must say no to the eliticization of a public good. 
65013	Mozambican authorities are expecting the bridge to sustain a daily average traffic of over four thousand vehicles, a significant increase of the average of 200 vehicles that cross the bay by boat today. 
65014	The untold tragedy of 28 Mauritanian soldiers executed on Independence Day · Global Voices 
65015	On November 28, 1990, 28 men in Inal, Mauritania, were hanged by fellow soldiers in a prison the middle of the night, meticulously selected one by one to be killed, after being accused of plotting a coup against the government. 
65016	The date, which also marks Mauritania's independence from France in 1960, continues to haunt some Mauritanians who seek justice for the brutal killings of these 28 men, all of whom were black. 
65017	The West African nation of Mauritania is a mix of Arab-Berber and black Africans and human rights groups say black Africans have long suffered discrimination and exploitation. 
65018	The president of the Inal-France Committee, Youba Dianka, explains: 
65019	I want to make it clear that Inal is just an example; there were many 'Inals' in Mauritania. 
65020	Horrific events happened in Azlatt, Sory Malé, Wothie, Walata, Jreida and in the valley. 
65021	Inside the military compound in Inal and its surroundings, soldiers were quartered, buried alive, shot, and hung in celebration of the country's independence in 1990. 
65022	On Independence Day this year, Mauritanians paid more attention to the nomination of their national football team to the Africa Cup of Nations (CAF) finals than they did to the forgotten "soldiers lay in solitude in anonymous pits ... still waiting for a decent burial," writes Kaaw Elimane Bilbassi Touré, news editor of the Mauritanian news site Le Flambeau. 
65023	Kiné-Fatim Diop, campaign director for Western Africa at Amnesty International, remarked this year on the contradictions between what should be a celebratory day and what most victims' families actually feel: 
65024	Each year, while the officials celebrate the ascension to sovereignty with joy, the victims' families cry and protest in sadness for justice and reparations. 
65025	The authorities are only trying to bury this hideous side of independence, just like when they secretly voted an amnesty law in 1993 affirming the state's amnesia concerning the soldiers' killings 30 years ago. 
65026	The Forum Against Impunity and Injustice in Mauritania expressed sorrow over the tragedy of two brothers in particular who were hanged on that tragic night: 
65027	Absolutely, a curse fell on the 28 soldiers that night. 
65028	Like the two brothers, Diallo Oumar Demba and his brother Diallo Ibrahima, who were hanged wearing consecutive numbers written on them with a pen. 
65029	What makes this sadder is having to witness your older brother's death. 
65030	The executioners did their work with accuracy, and were actually not stopping at the hanging part, but also dragging the dead and sitting on their corpses. 
65031	Survivors speak out 
65032	Testimonies from survivors continue to pour in after 30 years. 
65033	Mamadou Sy was a squadron commander in the Mauritanian army, then a deputy commander and finally a base commander before he was arrested that night. 
65034	In his book "Hell in Inal", published in 2000, he describes the torture he suffered, when military commanders blindfolded him, tied him up, and threw him in dirty, stinking water. 
65035	Another soldier who survived that dreadful night managed to go to France for treatment after his time in prison with the help of the Christian Association Against Torture (ACAT in French). 
65036	He testifies on the condition of anonymity on the racism he experienced in his 24 years of military service: 
65037	As far as I can remember, since I have started to understand, I have always noticed that black people never had any rights, and that the white Mauritanians were privileged. 
65038	Here, out of twenty ministers in the government, only a quarter are black and in the army, there is only one black person out of ten officers. 
65039	During an internship, if a white Mauritanian wouldn't perform well, they would still win over any other black person. 
65040	And don't even dare protesting ... 
65041	He describes the methods of torture he and other soldiers experienced: 
65042	For example, they dug holes in the sand, buried us up to the neck, with the head fixed, our naked face turned toward the sun. 
65043	If we ever tried to close our eyes, the guards would throw sand. 
65044	And then put the blindfolds back on. 
65045	Maimouna Alpha Sy, general secretary of the Widow and Humanitarian Issues Association, was once married to Ba Baïdy Alassane, a former customs controller. 
65046	Alpha Sy says her late husband was among the victims killed in 1990. 
65047	We spent three months and ten days looking for my husband, but in vain ... 
65048	Customs told us he died from a cardiac arrest, which is not true. 
65049	Witnesses were arrested, tied and tortured with him. 
65050	He was killed in front of them. 
65051	'Never again' 
65052	This year on November 28, Mauritanian immigrants protested in front of the Mauritanian embassy in Paris, France, against the state's disregard for this tragic episode. 
65053	Even if you are not directly responsible for the action that definitely stained every November 28, you still however were responsible for finding an adequate solution for the victims' rights to the truth and justice ... 
65054	Great nations and great people never try to erase a dark episode out of their history but instead they show it to the world for everyone to remember and say 'NEVER AGAIN'. 
65055	Mister prime minister, your power has preferred policies of marginalization and exclusion. 
65056	As of October 2018, out of 24 ministerial functions, only five are occupied by black or mixed people, who represent up to 70 percent of society. 
65057	The majority of the population are still under-represented among the elected representatives, members of the security forces, officials and local administrators. 
65058	Mauritania is the last country in the world to officially abolish slavery in 1981 but it wasn't enforced until 2007 and an estimated 20 percent still live in some form of enslaved servitude, most of whom are black or mixed. 
65059	Because this historic racism persists in present-day Mauritania, justice for the survivors and their families remains out of reach. 
65060	How free breakfast brought 500 girls back to school in Yemen · Global Voices 
65061	Students eating breakfast at school.

65063	Used with permission. 
65064	With the acute lack of resources caused by the war in Yemen, a growing number of families are forced but to take their children out of school. 
65065	Girls are often sent away to marry at ages as young as 13. 
65066	However, one school in the capital Sana'a found a modest, yet effective, form of relief. 
65067	The NGO Solidarios sin Fronteras (based in Spain and Yemen) run almost entirely by volunteers and funded primarily by individual donations — some as small as one euro per month—, has started to provide a complete breakfast for this school's girl students, who are aged six to 16. 
65068	Before the project began, one-fifth of them had been absent. 
65069	Little by little, they started to come back and, since September 2018, all 525 students are regularly attending classes, Solidarios' founders say. 
65070	I've spoken via Whatsapp with two of the NGO's founders, Eva, who I had previously met in person some years ago in Barcelona, and Faten, who is in Yemen. 
65071	They told me about how their project "Breakfasts to educate and protect" came about. 
65072	They also asked me to not disclose their full names or the name of the school for security concerns. 
65073	In March, 2018, one of the school's teachers reached out to Faten about an 8-year-old girl who seemed to grow thinner and more exhausted by the day. 
65074	Suddenly, she stopped attending school. 
65075	She had not been the first to quit, but she was the youngest. 
65076	The teacher talked to the family: they were in extreme financial need and had received offers to marry their daughter. 
65077	When speaking with Faten, the teacher wondered whether a daily food ration could motivate families to keep their daughters in school. 
65078	And the idea was born. 
65079	Faten says: 
65080	Most of daughters of workers of the textile factory, which was completely destroyed . 
65081	The families haven't salary for 3 years. 
65082	How could they cover food expenses? 
65083	The most important thing is that we're supporting them to complete their education. 
65084	Their families happy, as keeping them at school prevents them from staying at home or getting married at such a young age. 
65085	In March 2018, the United Nations declared the humanitarian crisis in Yemen the worst in the world. 
65086	With raging unemployment and inflation, 80 percent of the country's families are in debt and 65 percent struggle to buy food. Read more: In Yemen, war, bad management, and climate change are at fault for water shortage 
65087	Solidarios sin Fronteras consulted with a pediatrician to design the breakfast's menu. 
65088	Faten shops for groceries every morning and a married couple uses her kitchen to prepare, pack and transport the food. 
65089	During a 45-minute break at work, she rushes to the school to help the teachers distribute the meals. 
65090	Sometimes, her siblings come to help out, too. 
65091	This do-it-yourself spirit is true for the organization's three other programs. 
65092	With "Food aid for families," they distribute food packages for vulnerable families in the cities of Sanaa, Aden, Amran, Raydah, Hodeidah, Al Dorihimi, and displaced families from Taiz. 
65093	"Water for Yemen" maintains water reservoirs in the Amran and Raydah camps for internally displaced persons and "Rebuilding Socotra" provides cement for rebuilding houses and dig wells in the island of Socotra, devastated by hurricanes in 2015. 
65094	"What if we do it ourselves?” 
65095	Prepared breakfasts are distributed every morning at the school. 
65096	Photo by Faten for Solidarios sin Fronteras (Solidarity without Borders).

65098	It was on a trip to Yemen Eva took in 2012 that she met Faten. 
65099	Eva was watching a birthday party at the next table at a cafe in Sana'a and the birthday girl offered her cake. 
65100	The girl was Faten. 
65101	They became friends and have seen each other several times since, most recently in 2015, on Eva's latest trip to Sana'a. 
65102	Faten remembers: 
65103	A few weeks after the war began, I was on WhatsApp (as usual) and I asked Eva, "can we do something to help?". 
65104	She answered that she would look for an organization in Spain with her friend Noèlia, and I was to look for one here in Yemen. 
65105	Eva, who has 15 years of experience in international development, could not find any grassroots NGO working in Yemen that she could trust. 
65106	So she and Faten, along with a third friend Noèlia, decided to create their own that same year. 
65107	They regularly share photographs, videos, and detailed updates on the SSF's social media pages. 
65108	They also circulate content to raise awareness about the war in Yemen, in particular, the role of Spain and other countries who supply arms used in the conflict.

65110	Arsal Camp in Lebanon battered by snow during "Norma" storm, January 6, 2019.

65112	Syrian refugees in Lebanon face floods and freezing temperatures amidst a series of storms called "Norma" that hit on January 6, 2019. 
65113	It brought five days of high levels of rain on the Lebanese coast and snow on Mount Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. 
65114	The storm caused widespread damage in Lebanon, flooding highways and closing schools for two days in some regions of the country. 
65115	Syrian refugees had to battle the storm in makeshift informal camps, as Lebanese authorities do not allow for permanent structures to be built. 
65116	According to a U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) report published on January 9, "70,000 refugees living in around 850 informal settlements could be at risk of either flooding, heavy snow or extreme cold". 
65117	Another UNHCR article stated that more than 11,300 refugees had been affected: settlements in Dalhamiya in the Bekaa Valley have been completely flooded. 
65118	One refugee, Juriya Ramadan, told the UNHCR: 
65119	People are sick. 
65120	Everywhere there is water. 
65121	We cannot sleep at night. 
65122	It has been three days like this. 
65123	All night we sit and watch the kids and we cannot do anything for them. Their situation is very bad. 
65124	Sixty-year-old refugee Amina al Darak said: 
65125	We’ve never experienced such a situation before. 
65126	The mattresses and the duvets got wet. 
65127	We didn’t sleep all night. 
65128	I had to put blankets on wooden boards and lie there. 
65129	I can’t even make myself a cup of tea because of the flooding. 
65130	According to the Associated Press, the refugee settlement in Bar Elias in the Bekaa Valley, near Lebanon's longest river, the Litani, was flooded during the storm. 
65131	It is home to approximately 420 refugees, including 100 children. 
65132	The AP also reported that a Syrian girl lost her life after she drowned in an overflowing river north of Lebanon. 
65133	Additionally, the Lebanese Red Cross said that 200 people were forced to evacuate from their camp on Lebanon's northern border with Syria after a local river overflowed. 
65134	The camp of Arsal in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains received heavy snow and subsequent damage, and videos of the camp were widely shared on social media: 
65135	Some Syrians activists and Twitter users lamented the poor living conditions, adding that Syrian refugees are increasingly stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
65136	In other words, between poor living conditions in Lebanon, and serious security risks in an Assad-controlled Syria if they return. 
65137	Do you know why people are still here? 
65138	The answer is because Assad is still in his position.

65140	Some Syrian refugees denounce the negligence of local authority in the Bekaa. 
65141	For example, Hussam Mansour told Al Jazeera that he had called the local municipality of Ghazze in the Bekaa many times to raise the ground levels of the tents, to no avail. 
65142	Syrian refugees in Lebanon will have to face a new storm that will bring wind gusts of over 100 Km/h and 5 meters waves. 
65143	The storm, named Miriam, will peak on Tuesday, January 15. 
65144	UNCHR stated that emergency stocks and sanitation supplies were replenished in anticipation of the new storms. 
65145	Despite the difficulties endured by Syrian refugees throughout the country, Lebanese President Michel Aoun said that "the refugee crisis still weighs economically and socially and on security" and that refugees should return to Syria so that they could live "with dignity." 
65146	This is in line with the anti-refugee rhetoric taken by his party, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) over the years, and notably by his son-in-law and foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, who also heads the FPM. 
65147	Read: Why Syrian refugees in Lebanon fear going back to an Assad-controlled Syria 
65148	Aoun, an ally of the pro-Assad militant group Hezbollah, is pushing the international community to return Syrian refugees back to so-called 'safe areas' in Syria. 
65149	Some ministers in the Lebanese government denounced the push and claim that dozens of refugees who returned were killed. 
65150	Stories of returned refugees facing imprisonment, forced conscription or death have been floating around anti-Assad Syrian circles, particularly in the past couple of years. 
65151	Wessal al Mustafa, a refugee in Lebanon, told Aljazeera that "there is nothing to return to." 
65152	Another refugee, 25-year-old Sleiman Ahmad, told the Independent: “If I go back, I would be conscripted or arrested, I have a small daughter.

65159	Despite this, there is a generation of women who are breaking down barriers and establishing their own businesses. 
65160	Mufti Sadia started her business when there were no women in the clothing sector of Kashmir. Her boutique was among the first in the Srinagar after she decided to opt out of her previous job and work independently in the valley. 
65161	Facing many hurdles and challenges, Sadia started her own brand called 'Hangers, the closet' in 2014 at a shopping mall. Despite the negative comments, she has never looked back:

65164	Her family has been a source of inspiration for Sadia, who always helped her cope with the difficulties of being a new, female entrepreneur in the volatile state. 
65165	Hangers is now a known brand in the Kashmir region. 
65166	Sadia draws most of her customers through Instagram and Facebook. Most of her designer wear is aimed at giving the western touch to the Kashmiri traditional wear. 
65167	Starting from zero, she has expanded and hired a salesgirl among eleven others. 
65168	"The response is good so far, I get negative comments on social media, even by women, but I think the negative comments given to me have helped me grow into a better person to a better designer," Sadia adds.

65187	Why Bahrain's 'torture prince' can still visit the U.K. despite calls for his arrest · Global Voices 
65188	In recent months, the United Kingdom's relationship with its Gulf allies leapt into the spotlight with a unique espionage tale amidst a British media landscape otherwise dominated by Brexit. 
65189	In November 2018, 31-year-old British academic Matthew Hedges returned to the U.K. after spending seven months in a United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) jail, mostly in solitary confinement, on espionage charges. 
65190	Hedges' story, which initially received relatively little attention, made it to the front pages after the U.A.E., a U.K. ally, announced it was accusing Hedges of being a spy for MI6. 
65191	Hedges and the U.K. government deny the accusation. 
65192	Hedges' story calls attention to the U.K.'s long and complicated history of impunity when it comes to allegations of torture committed by its allies in the Gulf states, and reminds us of some of the reasons Bahrain's "torture prince," Prince Nasser bin Hamad, still has the privilege and pleasure of meandering through the U.K. despite clear evidence of abuse during Bahrain's 2011 uprising. 
65193	Hedges suffered abuses during his imprisonment in the U.A.E. that seemed to have surprised the U.K. government, but less surprising was the U.K. government's tepid response to his torture — in addition to solitary confinement for 23 hours every day, Hedges was drugged by his jailers — despite the fact that the U.A.E. is one of the U.K.'s main allies in the MENA region. 
65194	Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada, who had spent the entirety of the seven months campaigning for her husband's release, accused the U.K. government of ignoring her constant requests for aid. 
65195	The U.K.'s response to the Hedges story revealed yet another example of the leniency afforded by the U.K. to Gulf Arab governments. 
65196	And activists can't help but remember how and why Bahrain's notorious "torture prince" can still walk free. 
65197	Bahrain's 'torture prince' 
65198	Long before the U.K. government allegedly ignored the torture of one of its citizens at the hands of an ally, it faced a legal challenge at home for its role in protecting a notorious member of the kingdom of Bahrain: the king's son, Prince Nasser bin Hamad. 
65199	Nicknamed the "torture prince" by dissidents for taking part in the torture of activists who participated in the 2011 Bahraini revolution, he once tweeted: “If it was up to me, I’d give them all life .” 
65200	Indeed, bin Hamad, aged 24 at the beginning of Bahrain's uprising in 2011, was among those in Bahrain's ruling establishment calling for the brutal repression of protesters. 
65201	As the head of Bahrain's Olympic Committee, bin Hamad created a special commission to "identify and punish more than 150 members of the sporting community" who took part in the 2011 protests, according to Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB). 
65202	He publicly called for “a wall to fall on heads … even if they are an athlete … Bahrain is an island and there is nowhere to escape." 
65203	Rather than face prosecution in Bahrain, his father promoted the young prince to the commander of Bahrain's Royal Guard on June 19, 2011. 
65204	The Prince's relationship with the U.K. goes back to 2006 when he graduated from the country's elite Sandhurst Military Academy at the age of 19. From the Archives: Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa participating in military training in the UK and Canada - July 2006. 
65205	FF, ADHRB notes, also "alleges that Sheikh Nasser was involved in torture." A year later, however, the U.K. government opted to grant the "torture prince" immunity when FF called for his arrest during his July visit to the 2012 London Olympics as the head of Bahrain’s Olympic Committee. Instead, bin Hamad was spotted in the VIP section in one of London's stadiums that day: 
65206	The story doesn't end there, however. 
65207	In October 2014, the High Court in London ruled that bin Hamad was not immune from prosecution over torture claims, reviving hopes that he could be arrested. 
65208	As the Guardian reported, the dossier was then passed on to the war crimes team of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command. 
65209	The latter subsequently announced that "on the basis of the dossier submitted to it, the police are not investigating." 
65210	Part of the reason why the Metropolitan police decided not to investigate was simply that key witnesses are still in Bahraini prisons and therefore can't be interviewed. 
65211	Incidentally, bin Hamad's representatives made a similar argument, arguing that FF's allegations "have not been tested in a British court and that there have never been any proceedings against him." 
65212	In other words, bin Hamad's representatives argued that FF's allegations could not be tested in British courts without acknowledging that the reason is that key witnesses could not be present in any court or answer any questions by British police. 
65213	And so, just a few months later, in March of 2015, bin Hamad uploaded a video of himself jogging across London's Hyde Park, renewing calls for his arrest. 
65214	In fact, he's regularly traveled to the U.K. since the accusations, including to enjoy the yearly Royal Windsor Horse Show in the company of Queen Elizabeth II with his father, the King of Bahrain. 
65215	This blatant case of impunity has renewed questions as to whether the U.K. is living up to its international obligations, notably the U.N. Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment 1987, which says that states must criminalize torture and pursue public officials of other nations when they are present in the state's territory." 
65216	The U.K. signed it on March 15, 1985, and ratified it on December 8, 1988. 
65217	Upon signing the convention against torture, however, the U.K. also added: 
65218	The United Kingdom reserves the right to formulate, upon ratifying the Convention, any reservations or interpretative declarations which it might consider necessary.

65223	Since January 23, Caribbean nations have been engaged in decisive international diplomacy regarding Venezuela’s political impasse, most recently as co-architects of the “Montevideo Mechanism”, the four-part solution to the Venezuelan crisis proposed by Mexico, Uruguay and CARICOM at last week's meeting in Uruguay. 
65224	One member of CARICOM, however, has been less certain about its position regarding the Venezuelan nationals who have sought refuge within its borders. 
65225	As trucks carrying US-sponsored humanitarian aid arrived at the Venezuelan border last week, the Trinidad and Tobago government dodged questions in Parliament about whether it recognised that Venezuela was facing a humanitarian crisis, reiterating the diplomatic position of “non-interference and non-intervention” the country has taken as part of CARICOM. 
65226	Trinidad, the larger of the two islands forming the nation of Trinidad and Tobago, is located just 11km north of the Venezuelan mainland. 
65227	As the political and economic situation in Venezuela has worsened, the island has experienced a large influx of Venezuelans fleeing hardship and violence. 
65228	Some arrive clandestinely via Trinidad’s southern coast, others through the country’s ports. 
65229	Some estimates suggest that the country has taken in around 60,000 migrants, a significant figure for a country of 1.3 million inhabitants. 
65230	Trinidad and Tobago's decision to repatriate 82 Venezuelans in April 2018 drew harsh criticism from the UNHRC, which called the move a "forced deportation" that was in breach of international law. 
65231	With the world’s attention currently on the political impasse in Venezuela, the country’s lack of a cohesive approach to migration is attracting international scrutiny. 
65232	Incomplete legislation 
65233	Though the country's Cabinet adopted a national policy to address refugee and asylum matters back in 2014, it is not being implemented. 
65234	In its statement to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the government said that although it had acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention, and is signatory to both the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, a lack of legislation "has hindered the application of proper protection principles for refugees and asylum seekers." 
65235	As a result, asylum seekers and people with UNHCR refugee status end up being treated like undocumented migrants, with many ending up in the Immigration Detention Centre, exploited by employers, or, according to a January 2019 Refugees International (RI) report, "forced into illegality". 
65236	As things stand, Venezuelans wishing to claim protection in Trinidad and Tobago are subject to the terms of the country's Immigration Act, which holds that undocumented migrants can be detained, fined and, quite likely, deported. 
65237	After the rescue in Trinidad last week of 19 female teenagers believed to be Venezuelans from a major drug and prostitution ring, there have been renewed calls for Venezuelans to be allowed to work in the country. 
65238	The children of refugees and asylum seekers are also barred from attending public school in the country. 
65239	The Living Water Community, the Catholic charity that acts as the UNHCR’s implementation partner in Trinidad and Tobago, has been trying to put into practice a regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan, designed to meet the needs of Venezuelans fleeing the country. 
65240	Trinidadian journalist Wesley Gibbings has suggested that legislation (or lack thereof) wasn't the only fly in the ointment, also noting on Twitter that: 
65241	No doubt, some of the xenophobia being exhibited in #Trinidad stems from the fact that some continued to assert that #Venezuela's humanitarian crisis had been externally-generated propaganda and not lived experience. 
65242	The rest of the region 
65243	Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela have long enjoyed close diplomatic relations. 
65244	An oil and gas producer, the nation benefited from the late Venezuela president Hugo Chávez’s push for higher oil prices, and last year signed a major gas deal with Chávez’s embattled successor, Nicólas Maduro, that some critics have suggested may be a factor in the government's hesitation to acknowledge the Venezuelan situation as a humanitarian crisis. 
65245	But while the country is feeling the heat due to its proximity to Venezuela, the state of affairs in other Caribbean nations is not very different. 
65246	According to a paper co-authored by Rochelle Nakhid, the regional coordinator with the Living Water Community for UNHCR, among Commonwealth Caribbean countries, "only Belize has legislation for refugees, while Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have a refugee policy but no legislation." 
65247	Nakhid is optimistic, though, that the drafting process to incorporate international migration protocols is "being undertaken in a commendably participatory way" with key stakeholders, including the Immigration Division. 
65248	Meanwhile, refugees are protesting Trinidad and Tobago's failure to live up to its international obligations around migration issues, while diplomats emphasise the need for a proper structure to be put in place.

65257	A look at Syria's long history of feminist movements · Global Voices

65262	The following piece is the result of a partnership between Global Voices (GV) and the Syrian Female Journalists Network (SJFN). 
65263	It was written by GV MENA Newsroom editor Joey Ayoub with contributions by GV Italian translator Alice Bonfatti and GV writer Elias Abou Jaoudeh. 
65264	The Syrian feminist movement started at the end of the 1800s when the lands now known as Syria and Lebanon were under the Ottoman Empire. 
65265	We got an insight into this rich history through a conversation (in Arabic) between SFJN and Maya Alrahabi, co-founder of the Syrian Women’s Political Movement. 
65266	It was uploaded on SFJN's SoundCloud account. 
65267	It's no coincidence that the feminist movement started in the late 19th century during the time of Arabic Nahda, or awakening in English, a period of cultural renaissance that began in Egypt and soon spread to Lebanon, Syria and other Arabic-speaking countries. 
65268	While attention is usually given to such figures as the Egyptian Muslim scholar Rifa'a el-Tahtawi or the Lebanese Maronite scholar Butrus Al-Bustani, Alrahabi emphasizes the role of women in pioneering what would become the Syrian feminist movement. 
65269	Since the beginning of the movement, Syrian feminists joined the global call for basic rights for women such as the right to vote and education. 
65270	As we know, the first global feminist wave only talked of a few rights for women: Education, suffrage and the likes. 
65271	Syrian feminist activists were also demanding those rights at the end of the 19th century. 
65272	Syrian women gained the right to vote in 1953. 
65273	Alrahabi recalled women like Marianna Marrach who, as early as 1870, was already writing in newspapers and calling for the liberation of women (and may have been the first Arab woman to do so). 
65274	She was born in Aleppo and died in Aleppo, living long enough (1848-1919) to see her city pass from the hands of the Ottomans to that of the French. 
65275	Marrach may have even been the first woman to write in Arabic language newspapers. 
65276	She revived the tradition of Mujtama'at wa Majaless al-Adabyya Al-Nisa'iya or "women's literary circles" in her family home in Aleppo, fusing selected European influences with her own Syrian ones. 
65277	Alrahabi also refers to Mary Ajami and Adila Bayham Al Jazairi as excellent examples: 
65278	I remember for example Marya Ajami who founded in 1910 the magazine Al-Arous (the bride) and Adila Bayham Al-Jazairi who founded many feminist organisations whose purposes were educational and social as well as advocating for women's rights, and this coincided with the first global feminist wave. 
65279	The movement would continue, on and off, until the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, which saw the overthrow of the post-independence republic (1946–1963) and the rise of the Ba'ath party. 
65280	This was then followed by a second coup which toppled the leaders of the party in 1966 and installed Salah Jadid, followed again by a third coup by Hafez Assad who appointed himself the leader of Syria in 1970. 
65281	The Assad regime continues to rule Syria to this day since Hafez's son, Bashar, took over power when the former died in 2000. 
65282	The attitude of these regimes to the Syrian feminist movement was either to ban, contain, or absorb them. 
65283	This stopped the "natural development of the feminist movement," according to Alrahabi, with its remnants absorbed in the General Union of Syrian Women (GUSW). Besides the GUSW, she continued: 
65284	No other feminist organization has been given a license. And that has been ongoing since 1963. 
65285	Needless to say, what the GUSW could or could not do was severely limited from the start: 
65286	The GUSW was a quasi-governmental organisation whose work was just formal. Its actions amounted to just clapping for and celebrating the ruling party in Syria. 
65287	It didn’t provide any actual help to women. 
65288	According to Alrahabi, this monopoly by the state meant that Syrian feminists, as well as most Arab feminists, couldn't join the global second wave that started in the 1960s. 
65289	When the second wave of feminism in the world started around the 1960s, we started seeing the understanding of gender and gender roles in society. Here the development of feminism throughout the Arab world stopped due to the control of authoritarian regimes. 
65290	There were, however, some feminists in the Arab world who spoke of women's rights from a gender perspective. 
65291	Alrahabi gave the example of Hanan Nijme, who set up her own cultural salon in 1980 in Damascus. 
65292	Nijme was instrumental in demanding legal changes to improve the conditions of women and children in Syria and secured some concessions from the state. 
65293	The following is a brief biography of Nijme (in Arabic). 
65294	It is with this background in mind that Alrahabi interprets the Syrian revolution since 2011. 
65295	The 2011 revolution was a revolution against everything, and so the women had a role as revolutionary activists at the forefront of the revolution, and that extended to the important presence of women in organization (of protests, local councils etc). 
65296	Then Syrian feminist organizations that developed outside of that advocated for women’s rights and merged them into the demands of the revolution. 
65297	On another level, there were the extremist factions that interacted with women brutally and repressively and tried to send women centuries back. 
65298	So there were two fronts to fight during the revolution. 
65299	Egyptian parliament endorses constitutional amendments that could allow Sisi to rule until 2034 · Global Voices

65303	The following article is written by an Egyptian journalist who preferred to remain anonymous for security reasons. Of the 596 members of Egypt's parliament, 485 voted in favor of extending Egyptian President Abdelfattah al-Sisi's ruling term that could see the 64-year-old leader in power until 2034. 
65304	Originating in the house of representatives, the constitutional amendments had been preliminarily proposed by Sisi's die-hard political party "Tahya Masr" in early February 2019, which opened the channel for a parliamentary debate. 
65305	As a result, it received initial endorsement after three consecutive sessions that lasted for 10 hours on February 14. 
65306	The parliament's legislative commission received the amendments to be drafted into legislation and submitted to parliament with 60 days for a decisive vote. 
65307	If the government secures votes from two-thirds of members of parliament, a national referendum will be held in line with the conditions of the 2014 constitution authored by Sisi backers. 
65308	Proposed amendments to Egypt's constitution 
65309	Revision of the constitution gives the current political dynamics an overriding power and enshrines the military's position above the state. 
65310	Key among the proposed amendments is the proposed new article that allows Sisi to run for a third and fourth presidential term when his actual term was scheduled to end in 2022. Furthermore, the presidential clause amendment introduced an adjustment for Article 140 to extend the standard presidential term from four years to six years. The amendment further suggests that the rule could have a vice president or two vice presidents appointed. 
65311	The proposal guarantees unprecedented authority to the military, presenting an amendment to Article 200 that tackles the constitutional role of the military, adding the new phrase "protection of the constitution, democracy, the state, and its secular nature, and personal freedoms." 
65312	According to an analysis titled "Generalissimo Sisi," produced by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a foreign-policy think tank, this addendum grants the military "a constitutional right to carry out a coup and impose direct military rule, especially if an Islamist electoral victory threatens the 'secular' nature of the state. 
65313	It is worth noting that Egypt has been home for Islamists, represented mainly by the Muslim Brotherhood Organization which won the 2012 elections and was later toppled by Sisi in 2013. Since then, the Egyptian government has adopted a crackdown approach to Islamists. 
65314	In fact, the proposed amendments go beyond military clauses and further strongly curtail judicial independence. Articles 185, 193, and 190, which primarily deal with judiciary budgets, supreme constitutional court affairs, and the duties of the state council are likely to be revisited. 
65315	The proposed amendments give authority to the president to appoint heads of judicial, oversee secondments and promotions, and offer an advisory role to the head of state to become the arbiter for draft laws that regulate judicial affairs. 
65316	The amendments strip the state council of its right to review any judicial oversight over the contracts signed by the state or one of its public institutions — and does not designate a replacement. Considering that military interventions had been largely favored by a court ruling, gradually undermining Egypt's judicial autonomy, the suggested constitutional changes are bound to limit judicial power. 
65317	The reformation of the parliament was likewise addressed. According to the Washington Post, the amendments will "bring back a lower chamber, or Senate, with mainly an advisory role. The Senate would have a minimum of 250 members, with two-thirds elected directly and the remainder appointed by the president." 
65318	Human Rights Watch criticized the proposed amendments, saying that they would "undermine judicial independence and expand executive powers that are already being abused." 
65319	Sisi previously said that he wouldn't run for president — let alone for a second term — but he is the one who led the army's overthrow of former president and Muslim Brotherhood-affiliate Mohamed Morsi. 
65320	Sisi took office in 2014 following a landslide victory capitalizing on a popular anti-Muslim Brotherhood wave. 
65321	Sisi was then re-elected in 2018 virtually unchallenged. 
65322	Egyptian netizens sound off Egypt, a country of about 100 million citizens, is full of social media-savvy political activists who thrive despite the ongoing government crackdown on freedom of expression. 
65323	The parliament's move triggered reactions from across Egypt and other parts of the world accusing Sisi of being an authoritarian president. 
65324	Egyptian actor Amr Waked, known for his opposition to the government, tweeted while using the viral hashtag "لا لتعديل الدستور" (#NoforConstitutionalAmendments) 
65325	The rejection power is huge. 
65326	Let us all unite and coordinate among us, so we win. 
65327	It has been long since we agreed on a unified opinion. 
65328	Twitter activist Zahraa El Masry shared a video for MP Ahmed Tantawy, explicitly opposing the new constitutional amendments during the convened parliamentary session. The video has gone viral across social media: 
65329	Raise your head high, you're an Egyptian. Salute to Ahmed Tantawy. 
65330	May God Bless you. 
65331	Member of the Egyptian Parliament Haitham El Hariry, who voted against the proposal shared the names of the MPs who adopted the same vote through his twitter account. The name list include a number of 16 names that voted "No"

65336	The demand for electricity in the Middle East is expected to triple by 2050, accelerating the diversification of economies away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. 
65337	A report that looked into the global energy landscape up to 2050 by the Norwegian global quality assurance and risk management company DNV GL predicts a dramatic shift in the Middle East’s economies, policies, and, consequently, technology investments to meet the increasing demands. 
65338	Mohammed Alghoul, a Ph.D. student in solar energy at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia told Global Voices said that over half of the region's total energy output could come from renewable energy by 2050: 
65339	Energy demands in the UAE are expected to grow rapidly in the Middle East because of the rapid growth the region’s population. 
65340	The increase in demand and the decrease in the cost of renewables will mean that more than half of the region’s total energy output will come from variable renewables by 2050. 
65341	DNV GL’s Energy Transition Outlook 2018 states that the transition of investment to renewables in the region makes complete sense — triggered by the falling costs of solar and wind technologies as well as the abundance of sun and wind in the region. 
65342	Alghoul adds: 
65343	“There will be more demand for electricity for cooling buildings and for water desalination, particularly in the desert, and wind and solar have the potential to provide cheaper power. ... 
65344	And, unlike fossil fuels, these resources will not run out. 
65345	And oil-and-gas-rich countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already started investing in renewable energy — especially solar. 
65346	Saudi Arabia, which has the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, is investing in 9.5 gigawatts of solar and wind by 2023, according to DNV GL. 
65347	Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 development plan includes a new commitment to renewable energy including 30 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2030. 
65348	Yet, the kingdom's vision has been heavily scrutinized and called into question in light of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. 
65349	The UAE, which sits on eight percent of the world’s oil reserves, is also investing heavily in its renewable energy capacities and aims to have 50 percent of its energy from renewables by 2050. 
65350	Both oil giants are also encouraging others in the region to develop their renewable energy infrastructure to strengthen energy security and create jobs — a memorandum was signed in 2017 to develop a grid that interlinks the power supply in the Arab world. 
65351	In fact, according to findings by Greentech Media (GTM), due to the launch of a number of new solar projects in the region, oil prices have dropped to a record low. 
65352	Findings from a report by Global Solar Market Attractiveness Index also predict that Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Jordan will collectively install more than 22.4 gigawatts capacity in the next four years. 
65353	But despite falling costs, most of the region still awaits solar markets to mature on a commercial level says Abdullah Umer, project manager at King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. 
65354	A major factor for this could be the distorted energy markets throughout most of the region. 
65355	Umer states: 
65356	Most countries in the region have used their surplus oil production to balance out subsidizing fuel and electricity prices domestically to varying extents for many years with what they claimed were reasons to foster investments and businesses. 
65357	A report by the International Monetary Fund that analyzed five Middle Eastern markets showed that in 2015, fuel subsidies totaled nearly USD $150 billion — with Saudi Arabia making up nearly 72 percent. 
65358	GTM Research calculates that the average cost of solar PV could be competitive with grid electricity if it wasn't artificially lowered. 
65359	But Umer adds that falling oil prices are making regional oil-producing countries re-evaluate their fuel subsidies — potentially opening some doors for solar developers. 
65360	And the regional oil-rich nations can look to Jordan when it comes to policies on fostering a solar industry, which, according to GTM, stands out as one of the only countries to have an attractive market for commercial-scale solar. 
65361	Jordan passed the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law in 2012 and has actively been looking toward renewable energy since. 
65362	Renewable energy projects could make Jordan, a country which is otherwise completely reliant on oil imports for fuel, more energy independent. 
65363	The Shams Ma’an plant, built by a U.S.-based solar energy company, First Solar, opened in 2016 and powers 35,000 homes near Petra and the royal palace is also completely powered by a solar plant. 
65364	According to Alghoul: 
65365	Jordan, unlike most of its neighbors, is supporting its growing solar industry. 
65366	It has removed fuel subsidies and is providing institutional support to the renewable energy industries through energy transition laws. 
65367	Jordan’s national Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund also offers debt and equity-based incentives to small to medium scale projects in partnership with six commercial banks. 
65368	The country has already seen over US $2.5 billion in investment since 2012. 
65369	Alghoul predicts: 
65370	If countries remove their subsidies, solar will be allowed to compete in a free market and it will very likely see prices fall.

65373	A version of this article was originally published by the freedom of expression organisation ARTICLE 19, as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
65374	Eight environmental activists in Iran have been in detention for over a year after they were arrested and charged with “espionage” and “spreading corruption on earth”. 
65375	They were finally brought to trial on January 30, 2019. The corruption charge they face, under Iran's penal code, carries a possible death sentence. The eight activists, Niloufar Bayani, Sam Radjabi, Houman Jowkar, Taher Ghadirian, Morad Tahbaz, Sepideh Kashani, Amir Hossein Khaleghi and Abdolreza Kouhpayeh, all worked for the Tehran-based Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF), and were arrested in January 2018, along with Kavous Seyed-Emami, the managing director of PWHF. 
65376	Seyed-Emani died on 8 February 2018 while in custody in Evin prison. While the judiciary says Seyede-Emani died by suicide, both the domestic and international community have called for an independent investigation into his death, which has not yet taken place. 
65377	The government’s case against the activists focuses heavily on the group’s work to protect the Asiatic cheetah, a wild cat native to eastern Iran that is nearing extinction. 
65378	Most members of the group had studied outside Iran, mainly in Canada and the US, and had ties to international environmental expert groups, some of whom have visited Iran in an effort to learn more about the cats and potentially help in their preservation. 
65379	Iranian officials have seized on the defendants' connections with foreign universities and used them to support accusations that the activists are foreign intelligence agents masquerading as environmental experts. 
65380	All defendants were initially accused of "espionage" and detained while awaiting trial, but Tehran Prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi announced on 24 October 2018 that charges against four of them had been changed to “spreading corruption on earth,” which is punishable by death. 
65381	Public prosecutors built much of their case against the group from a forced confession made by one of the activists, which has since been retracted. 
65382	On 30 January and 2 February 2019, the eight conservationists faced trial at Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court, presided by Judge Salavati, who has a history of issuing disproportionate and oppressive sentences to human rights defenders. 
65383	According to the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), half of the 300-page indictment was read in these sessions, all of which was based on the confessions of one of the eight defendants, Niloufar Bayani. 
65384	Bayani interrupted the court multiple times to object, saying that her confessions were made under duress, are false and that she had retracted them. 
65385	Other serious and concerning allegations have been made about the trials, including that the trials are being held behind closed doors, the defendants were not given the right to choose their lawyers, and that not all the judiciary-appointed defence lawyers were present in court.

65387	The treatment the defendants have faced has violated their rights to life, freedom of expression, fair trial and due process of law. 
65388	It also marks part of a trend of silencing those speaking out on environmental issues in the country using espionage charges.

65394	The repatriation of African artifacts to countries of origin is tricky business · Global Voices 
65395	in November 2017, in a speech at the University of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that "African patrimony" should no longer be featured in European museums and that measures should be taken for its temporary or definitive restitution back to Africa. 
65396	Following this request, lecturers Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy from the University of Gaston-Berger in Saint-Louis, Senegal, and the Technische Universität of Berlin, Germany, wrote a report to explain a suggested legal process for returning Africa's artifacts and treasures, rejecting the notion that these collections belong to French heritage. 
65397	The restitution of African art has been an ongoing debate for decades. European colonial powers used monumental archaeology to appear as the guardian of the colonized history, reinforcing an unconscious sense of ownership. Repatriation proponents say former colonial powers appropriated ancient art of colonized cultures and their museums, located in the West, prevent nationals from learning and embracing their own history. Today, French public museums store about 90,000 sub-Saharan African art pieces, mostly obtained through theft and colonial privilege. 
65398	Journalists Konsimbo Ophelie and Poda Gabriel explain in Nsi mababu, a pan-African newspaper: 
65399	According to experts, more than 90 percent of black African artwork are found outside of the continent. 
65400	Stolen during the colonization times, most of them are found in the property of the British Museum, the Quai Branly Museum, or the Berlin Museum. 
65401	Today, countries like Benin, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (among others) claim the return of their stolen treasures. The issue of the restitution contains tricky political elements. We need to understand the ins and outs of this. 
65402	Many African countries were affected by this looting, which represents 85 to 90 percent of African artistic heritage. Eva Rassoul, a journalist, explains on France Culture, a French radio program: 
65403	The artwork found in the French museums predominantly originate from Chad (9,200 artwork), Cameroon (7,800) and Madagascar (7,500). 
65404	Savoy and Sarr explained the legal process for repatriation of Africa's stolen artificats on TV5 Monde: 
65405	Journalist Philippe Rey says the report looks at the role France played in the pillage of Africa's heritage: 
65406	It recounts the dispossession through the history of the world, evaluates the role of France, examines a preliminary inventory of the stolen artwork, narrates the African tentative for the heritage re-appropriation, analyses the legal questions, and lists a number of useful recommendations for the restitution process. This work is one of the most ambitious project of the 21st century. Journalist Laurent Adjovi in Benin celebrates France's move to return 26 artifacts taken from Benin: 
65407	Thanks to open discussions with France, Patrice Talon can offer Beninese people the chance to see some of their artwork again. 
65408	An example of this is the royal artwork, showing the reigns of the kings Abomey Ghézo (1818-1858), Glélé (1858-1889) and Béhanzin (1890-1894), thrones, recades, and royal scepters. 
65409	In the spirit of showcasing African heritage and artifacts, Senegal unveiled the Museum of Black Civilizations on December 6, 2018, supported by Senegalese President Macky Sall. The museum adds to other cultural sites such as the House of Slaves and the Henriette-Bathily Women's Museum. 
65410	This comes at a time where the debate is at its loudest concerning the stolen African cultural assets by France during the colonization. It is a fifty years old dream come true. 
65411	Ivory Coast's minister of culture, Bandama Maurice, says repatriation of his country's historical artwork is definitely in the works: 
65412	We think that in 2019, most or all of the 148 artwork will be given back to Ivory Coast. The reason we have asked for this number is because we can only accommodate that many in the museum collections. 
65413	In the Republic of Congo, too, the Museum of the African Circle was recently inaugurated in Pointe-Noire, a port city, to invite youth to connect to their history and culture. 
65414	Before being converted into a museum in 2017, this building used to be a former cultural place for Congolese people in the first place, then a law court and finally an abandoned place. Since its opening to the public on December 4, the Museum of the African Circle has already welcomed more than 600 visitors per month. 
65415	Nevertheless, the process to return African artifacts is difficult and many issues must be resolved before they can be returned. Journalist Yassin Ciyow raises the complexity of this process for Neomag magazine, stating how many of the acquired artifacts were technically given — or taken — as "gifts" during colonial periods. ... stolen artifacts from the colonial times were generally given or donated to French public collections. 
65416	Nevertheless, exception laws have been voted in the past in order to decommission some works. It is because of this legal twist that the Venus Hottentote could be returned to South Africa, and the Maori heads to New Zealand. 
65417	Besides the legal difficulties, protection and maintenance of these rare African artifacts once returned has also raised concerns.

65461	Dijaawa Wotunnöi: an animated short film helps revitalise the Yekuana language · Global Voices 
65462	Dijaawa Wotunnöi is an ancestral myth of the Yekuana, an indigenous people who live in Venezuela and Brazil, that was turned into a short animated film by Saúl Kuyujani López. 
65463	The film is completely spoken in Yekuana and has subtitles in Spanish. Several Yekuanas participated in the project as translators and researchers, and also contributed their voice to the film's characters. 
65464	The author of this story was also part of the production team. 
65465	The myth explains how the Yekuana people came to be descendants of bats. Part of the explanation lies with the life story of Kawashidi, a Yekuana man whose wife is killed by an evil spirit who then challenges him and tests his intelligence. 
65466	Saúl Kuyujani López documented the myth as it's told in the community of Santa María de Erebato, located in the banks of the Caura river (Alto Caura) in the Bolivar state, Venezuela. 
65467	According to Venezuela's 2011 census, there are 7,997 Yekuanas living in the states of Amazonas and Bolivar. Brazil's 2000 census registered around 430 Yekuanas living in the country. 
65468	The UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger classifies Yekuana as a vulnerable language. Yekuana teachers say that most parents do not consider important to pass on their language to future generations. Many take their children to cities so they can learn to speak Spanish well. As a result, children lose their family's language. 
65469	For this reason, the animated adaptation of Dijaawa Wotunnöi aims to preserve the oral aspects of the Yekuana language through the audiovisual format. 
65470	The film was produced by Creaser Creative Studio and supported by the Indigenous Organization of the Cayu Kuyujani Basin and the Humboldt Forum. 
65471	The first screening took place at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, Germany, in July 2017. 
65472	The short film was selected in the official programme of the 13th International Film and Communication Festival of Indigenous / Native Peoples (FICMAYAB), which was held in Guatemala in October 2018. The national premiere was held at the Indigenous Film Festival of Venezuela, in November 2018.

65486	For nearly a day's time, most of Venezuela has been without electricity. 
65487	At approximate 4:50 p.m. local time on March 7, full-scale power outages in the capital Caracas and at least 22 other states have left homes, businesses, public services, and hospitals without power. 
65488	By the early hours of March 8, journalists and civilians in the country who were able to use mobile data began reporting online that generators and other back-up supplies of power were running low. Officials in the government of embattled president Nicolás Maduro say the outage is the result of "sabotage," calling it an "electrical war" perpetrated by opposition leader Juan Guaidó, with the backing of the US government. 
65489	Guaidó fired back, saying that "the only sabotage here is being done by the usurper of the Venezuelan people," in a reference to President Nicolás Maduro, who opposition leaders say "usurped" the presidency through an illegitimate election process. 
65490	Blackouts are nothing new in Venezuela — in the midst of the economic, social and political crises that have engulfed the country in recent years, citizens have faced regular power outages. 
65491	But the broad coverage and duration of this one are unique. 
65492	In addition to leaving residents without access to light, refrigeration, medical technology and transportation powered by electricity, the blackout has also precipitated an almost total shutdown of communication systems in the country. 
65493	In Yemen, war, bad management and climate change are at fault for water shortage · Global Voices 
65494	Screenshot of a little girl surrounded by empty containers, taken from a video by Positive Yemen. 
65495	Yemen, the stage of one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, is facing a severe water crisis: 16 million people lack access to clean water in the country, according to UNICEF. 
65496	"What is worse than not having the most basic human right, water?" asks Shoushou, a young activist from the capital Sana'a, in a conversation with Global Voices. 
65497	Sana’a is among the 10 most water-scarce cities in the world and is at the risk of running dry in a few years. Yemenis use 95 percent less water than the average resident of the United States. 
65498	Three years of war undoubtedly affected water sources as reservoirs and pipelines were regularly targeted. 
65499	In February 2016, there were reports that Saudi planes had bombed and destroyed a reservoir that supplied drinking water for 30,000 Yemenis. This was shortly after a bombing of a major desalination plant in the city of Mokha, also allegedly by the Saudi-led coalition. However, poor management also helps explain the deteriorating situation. 
65500	Drilling for limited groundwater has long been the norm for the Yemeni government and it's unlikely that authorities will implement more sustainable strategies as the war rages on. 
65501	"I blame the government for not managing and supervising the water crisis. No one cares about the people," Shoushou tells Global Voices. 
65502	While groundwater is drastically depleted, Yemen’s climate seems to be getting drier. In 2009, the UN Food and Agriculture Agency (FAO) forecasted that Yemen could be the first county in the world to exhaust the entirety of its groundwater resources. 
65503	Water is already very expensive in the country, with ordinary citizens paying over 30 percent of their income just to have water supplied to their houses. It's the highest rate in the world. 
65504	As the crisis deepens, combatants treat the resource as a weapon. Both the Houthi and Saudi-backed forces have repeatedly blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid consisting of food and water, leaving many Yemenis with no choice but to store as much water as they can, most of the time in unsanitary conditions. 
65505	Fetching water is also a challenge in Yemen. The responsibility of collecting water, when sources are located far from human settlements, tends to fall upon women and girls. The long journey leaves them exposed to sexual harassment. 
65506	They are at risk of drowning in open water reservoirs or of suffering miscarriages caused by carrying heavy containers. 
65507	Young girls who are unable to carry heavy lifts often have to make more than one trip. The mission can take the whole day, making them miss school. 
65508	Cholera outbreaks 
65509	The inadequate water storage has led to an epidemic of cholera in Yemen, the largest and fastest-spreading epidemic on record. More than 1.1 million suspected cholera cases recorded since April 2017 with over 2,300 associated deaths. One in 62 Yemenis is suspected of having Cholera. 
65510	A lot of them are children under the age of seven. 
65511	Hospitals reportedly receive around 60 to 70 suspected cases each day. 
65512	The World Health Organization is warning that a third wave of cholera is possible after two major waves in recent years. 
65513	Fortunately, treating Cholera is relatively easy, with a combination of antibiotics and intravenous fluids usually being enough to reverse even severe cases. But treatment must begin shortly after symptoms show up, or else it can be fatal. 
65514	Poor access to healthcare poses a challenge to treatment: in 2017, nearly 17 million people in Yemen did not have access to basic health services. Only 45 percent of the country's health facilities are currently operating. 
65515	Despite the efforts of international human rights programs like UNICEF and WHO, this scarcity is leaving many Yemenis untreated. The airstrikes in August 2018 did not only kill a dozen Yemenis. It also damaged Al Thawra Hospital in Hudaydah.

65517	The hospital averages around 50,000 consultations a month and is a major center for cholera treatment. After the attack, the cholera cases in Hodeidah rose by almost a third. 
65518	Grassroots project 
65519	Project #سقيا_1000‬⁩ aims to provide free water for those in most need. 
65520	Launched in November 2017, it aims to fill 1000 tanks of water in the capital Sana'a and its environs. They reached their goal in February 2018. The project currently benefits 6,194 families or 39,789 individuals. 
65521	The activists also install new reservoirs and provide periodical cleaning and maintenance to new and existing tanks. 
65522	So far, they have installed 14 new tanks, while filling 74 and helping maintain 21 existing tanks. The whole project is based on donations from people in Yemen and abroad. It is their only source of funds. 
65523	Omar Mohamad, a Yemeni activist involved in the project, told Global Voices: 
65524	The project started on social media. We got the support of people from inside and outside Yemen. Their support was the main reason we were able to succeed. 
65525	Alhamdulillah, we reached our goal in February 2018. After that, the movement turned into a project that regularly ensures reservoirs are filled. In the first half of this year, the project was working perfectly and according to the plan.

65529	Emirati activist Osama al-Najjar remains in unlawful detention, despite having completed his three-year jail sentence more than two years ago. 
65530	Al-Najjar was arrested in March 2014 for posting tweets denouncing that his father had been tortured in prison, and calling for his release and that of other prisoners of conscience in the Emirates. 
65531	Osama's father, Hussain Al-Najjar, is one of 94 Emirati activists who were prosecuted en masse in 2013 for calling for political reform in the Emirates on charges related to “harming State Security”. 
65532	He is currently serving 11 years in prison. 
65533	In November 2014, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, sentenced Osama to three years in jail under the country's cybercrime law on a number of charges that include “instigating hatred” against the state and “designing and running a website satirical and defaming ideas and information”. 
65534	He was due to be released on 17 March, 2017, but at the request of public prosecution, the court deemed him a "threat" to national security and extended his detention without specifying for how long. 
65535	Two year later, Osama remains behind bars, with no end to his detention in sight. 
65536	In a recent statement marking the anniversary of the end of his official sentence, the International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE said: 
65537	As there is no trial proceeding this form of detention, those transferred to such facilities can be held indefinitely with the government - rather than the judiciary - handing down punishment. 
65538	This type of administrative detention grossly violates international standards of due process. 
65539	Although he was not convicted of a terrorist offence, Osama is being held at a counselling centre at al-Razeen prison under the country's counter-terrorism law. 
65540	Emirati authorities claim that the purpose of these facilities is to offer guidance to those considered to be "a threat against the state". 
65541	However, rights groups say that authorities are using counter-terrorism and these so-called counselling centres as a pretext to indefinitely extend the detention of prisoners of conscience.

65546	Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule, arrived in Myanmar on March 7, 1929, to collect donations from Indian nationals for the Handloom Association of India, and share his experiences with the Burmese people. 
65547	He addressed people at Jubilee Hall and Fytche Square (now Mahabandoola Park) in Yangon. 
65548	He held talks with Buddhist monks at Shwedagon Pagoda: 
65549	I am glad to find you telling me that the hponegyis (Buddhist monks) are leading the political movement in Burma, but you have a serious responsibility upon your shoulders when you undertake leading a political battle. 
65550	History shows that the clergy has not always interfered with the political matters to the benefit of mankind. Very often unworthy ambition has moved the clergy of the world as it has moved unscrupulous men to take part in politics, and if now you hponegyis aspire to lead the political movement of this, one of the fairest lands on the face of the earth, you are shouldering a tremendous responsibility. 
65551	In his two-week visit, he visited several towns in central and lower Myanmar. 
65552	In Mandalay, he said: 
65553	In India it is a common saying that the way to swaraj (which means independence for India) is through Mandalay. 
65554	The British government has taught you too a great lesson by incarcerating one of India’s great sons here. 
65555	The way to swaraj is the way of suffering—indeed no country has come to its own without suffering. 
65556	Indian political leader Subhas Chandra Bose was imprisoned in October 1924 in Mandalay for two and half years due to his defiance of colonial rule. 
65557	During his visit, Gandhi said: 
65558	I have no other and no better guidance to offer to you than to commend to your attention the general principle of non-violence, in other words, self-purification. 
65559	He wrapped up his third visit to Myanmar on March 24. 
65560	Prior to the 1929 visit, he had been in Myanmar in 1902 and 1915.

65573	Alaa was a leading voice among Egyptian bloggers and technology activists in Cairo approaching and during the Egyptian Revolution. 
65574	Together with his wife, Manal Hassan, he helped develop on a range of technology and political activism projects working with activists and bloggers in the region and beyond, including with many members of the Global Voices community. 
65575	The 37-year-old activist was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November 2013. 
65576	More than one year later, in February 2015, he was finally tried and sentenced to five years in prison for “organising” a protest under a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorised demonstrations. 
65577	While he did take part in a protest against military trials for civilians on 26 November 2013, Alaa had no role in organising it.

65590	Will collective farming by artists save one of Manila's remaining urban fields? · Global Voices 
65591	Artists and volunteers participating in a land cultivation activity.

65593	In the Philippines, a group of artists and volunteers have turned themselves into farmers to cultivate a piece of land situated in the heart of the larger metropolitan area of Manila as part of a campaign to prevent evictions of land tillers. 
65594	The group, which belongs to the Alliance for Genuine Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, an organization known locally as SAKA, advocates for peasant rights in the Philippines. 
65595	In an interview with this author, SAKA leader Angelo Suarez explained what motivated the group to organize what is called a a bungkalan, a collective land cultivation in Quezon City, one of the sixteen cities making up Metro Manila whose total population reached nearly 13 million in the last 2015 census. 
65596	As peasant advocates who advance agroecology, we wanted to participate in agricultural production. 
65597	In the spirit of bungkalan, we thought this was a great chance to start participating in production and learning the rudiments of both organic agroecology and organizing a community for the assertion of people’s rights. 
65598	Suarez related the complicated history of this specific piece of land: initially used as farming land, it was grabbed from peasant communities in the 1930s to become a territory of the newly established Quezon City. 
65599	Its status changed again in the 1950s when it was donated by the government to the University of the Philippines Diliman (UP), the country's premier state university. The land then remained underdeveloped over the next five decades despite the rapid urbanization of Quezon City. 
65600	In the mid-2000s, the local peasant community successfully petitioned the government to put the land under the coverage of the agrarian reform program but UP contested this notice of coverage by ‘colluding’ with the Quezon City local government in rejecting the terrain’s agricultural classification. Indeed UP plans to build a parking lot in the community. 
65601	Yet Suarez is adamant the land should be considered as an agricultural area, as he explained: 
65602	It is a bit strange that a farmland can exist in what appears to be a highly industrialized city. But given the reality of uneven development, there does exist a large farmland in Quezon City that resembles nothing of its urban surroundings. Sure, it’s not agricultural on paper—but all it takes is a quick visit to the actual site to determine there’s nothing industrialized about this part of Quezon City at all. 
65603	In fact, it is so bereft of industrialization that much of the work carried out on the farm is done by hand. The farmers cannot even afford the fuel needed by their rusty old hand tractor to make it work. Even threshing unhusked rice is done manually. 
65604	What SAKA does is help maintain—and eventually prove—the agricultural status of this farmland by keeping it productive. 
65605	Suarez said SAKA started working in the area in early 2019. 
65606	We sought permission from the local peasant community to let us till the few square meters they had left unkempt for its difficulty to till. We worked the land for months, till it’s finally able to yield eggplant, okra, pechay , string beans, and other vegetables. 
65607	We are yet to devise a more efficient system for portioning out the produce among those who’ve worked on it, but for a good span of time all produce was for anybody’s taking: primarily the resident farming community, then the SAKA volunteers who’ve worked on it. 
65608	But the group now faces a series of challenges: 
65609	The first challenge is the fact that, being artists, literally none of us is a farming expert. 
65610	Once in a while we get volunteers who have experience in urban gardening and amateur organic farming—but this land is the real deal, we’re practically starting from scratch on actual agricultural land. 
65611	Another setback is our lack of experience in organizing. Many of us in SAKA are new activists, and while we are guided by seasoned peasant organizers, many of them spend more time in the countryside where most of our peasant communities are. 
65612	Suarez reported how a series of rains flooded SAKA’s little portion of the farm, thus they started digging a makeshift canal system to get rid of excess rainwater. This project has become their number one priority and will remain so in the next few months: 
65613	So we have to work double-time in gathering volunteers to join us. To do this, we have been actively campaigning in different forums, talking about bungkalan as a nation-wide mass movement that plays a significant role in the peasant struggle, as well as about bungkalan itself as an urgent intervention in UP’s forthcoming eviction of resident peasants. 
65614	It is unclear if the law signed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on August 2019 allowing UP to sell portions of the farming land to the Quezon City government would resolve the dispute. But initiatives like the bungkalan organized by SAKA are helpful in raising awareness about the need to preserve this farmland in the center of Quezon City, and to resist the eviction threat against residents in the community.

65622	On Twitter, this Brazilian writer illuminates stories from black history · Global Voices 
65623	Ale Santos, researcher and writer. 
65624	Photo by Paulinho, used with permission. 
65625	There is a tree that grows in Africa, the Middle-East, and Australia called baobab (adansonia). 
65626	Some African peoples used to believe that if you walked around it, you would forget something about your life. 
65627	Before forcing captured people into their ships, slavers would force them to walk in circles around the tree of oblivion so that they'd leave their culture and lives behind. 
65628	Brazilian writer Ale Santos tells that anecdote in the preface of his book Rastros da Resistência ("trails of resistance," in Portuguese), a collection of 20 stories about real-life black heroes, published in October in Brazil. 
65629	Despite European efforts to erase the identities and roots of the people enslaved, Santos says in the book, an oral tradition kept the history of Africa and its diaspora alive; stories such as that of the baobab are now crucial to reimagine cultural realms once considered lost. He writes: 
65630	In Western Africa, there were the griots (or djéli, in French), guardians of the oral tradition. 
65631	They had a prominent position and sometimes also performed other jobs, such as messengers, heralds, war councillors, artisans. 
65632	But, most importantly, they were the living record of the main events of their people. 
65633	The book was the result of a year and a half of research and models Santos' Twitter account, @savagefiction, which is well-known in Brazil for its threads on Africa and its diaspora's history. 
65634	Santos first began to narrate those historical events on WhatsApp, in small groups with his friends. 
65635	In June 2018, he decided to move the storytelling to Twitter. 
65636	A thread about the genocide of 8-10 million people in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo between the late 19th and the early 20th century, perpetrated by Leopold II of Belgium, was Santos' first thread to go viral: 
65637	There is so much historical injustice against the African people, to consider the Jewish Holocaust as the greatest crime against humanity is a mistake. 
65638	Leopold II was a far bloodthirstier monster. 
65639	This is a sad thread, but necessary, to those who still don't know the Congo's holocaust. 
65640	Santos then realized that stories were a powerful weapon of knowledge. 
65641	After the King Leopold's thread, he wrote about human zoos, where natives from regions colonized by Europe were displayed like animals: 
65642	Europeans must be enthusiastic about the lack of historical memory in colonized countries. 
65643	It's easy to forget the cruel and devastating past when no one talks about it. 
65644	This thread is for those who don't know about the inhumane racist zoos that existed around the world. 
65645	Santos mainly focuses on little-known Brazilian historical figures, such as Dragão do Mar ("dragon of the sea"), a leader of raft workers who stopped the slave trade in the northeastern state of Ceará, and Tereza de Benguela, queen of a quilombo (settlements from the colonial times, whose inhabitants were, mostly, people who had escaped slavery); one time, he wrote about the politics of population whitening in early 20th century Brazil, or events such as the mass killing of 111 inmates in a São Paulo prison in 1992. 
65646	Many people don't know, but Brazil has stories of abolitionists that would make any black person shiver and light a proud ancestral flame for our struggle. 
65647	I'll tell one of them on this thread, about a fearless warrior known as a mythological beast: Dragão do Mar (dragon of the sea) 
65648	In 2003, a law made African-Brazilian History and Culture a mandatory subject on the national curriculum. 
65649	Sixteen years on, it’s not yet implemented on all schools, usually depending on isolated individual initiatives. 
65650	Brazil was the last country in the Western hemisphere to abolish slavery, in 1888, and the highest receiver of enslaved African people: the Slave Voyages database says that 5,099,816 people were disembarked as slaves in the country from the 1500s until 1875. 
65651	As Santos told Global Voices via WhatsApp, there is an unfortunate tradition of recounting history from the perspective of the colonizers. 
65652	Eurocentrism left deep scars in every country that went through colonization, which stole their diversity and culture were stolen, he says. 
65653	To tell the stories that exist marginally to historiography is to give those people a new dignity, reestablish their importance, in a democratic movement, an environment where everyone feels appreciated. 
65654	Really, that impacts the individual. 
65655	It impacts the way society sees that individual, free of stereotypes, acknowledging their ancestry, their cultural value within the society, in any democracy. 
65656	Santos also received praise from Brazilian rapper Emicida. 
65657	Writing for on the book's dust jacket, the rapper compares the erasure of black identity and tradition by the slavery system with walking around with only your shadow to look at, without any reflection in the mirror. 
65658	Structural racism takes aim at non-white bodies, the culture targets our imaginary. 
65659	It is there where it tries to knock you out before you can even step into the ring. 
65660	In a joint effort, they both try to ensure that René Descartes’ sentence — “I think, therefore I am” — doesn't make any sense to you. 
65661	Human beings invented who they are thanks to the ability of shaping the imaginary of our equals through stories.

65663	Photo from the "Mesada" album, in commemoration of the one-month anniversary of the 2019 uprising in Chile. Used with permission. 
65664	In 1981, during Augusto Pinochet's US-backed dictatorship in Chile, a group of photographers that included co-founder Paz Errázuriz created the Association of Independent Photographers (AFI for its initials in Spanish) to visually document human rights abuses happening on the streets of the capital Santiago. 
65665	Almost thirty years later, during the 2011-2013 student protests across Chile, another group of professional and amateur photographers revived the name and created AFI Santiago for a similar purpose. Sharing their photos on social media, the group has an extensive gallery on their Facebook page from various ongoing conflicts. 
65666	In an email interview with Rodrigo Segovia, a member of the group, AFI Santiago states that its aim is to “create independent, consistent, and truthful media with the national and international community, planting a seed in new generations of greater awareness and respect for the fundamental rights of humans.” 
65667	AFI Santiago recently published an album titled "Mesada" in commemoration of the one-month anniversary of the current uprising, which focuses on economic inequality. Police crackdown has left 23 people dead and thousands injured across Chile so far. 
65668	The following photos have been shared by AFI Santiago for republication and spans the time period from their launch to the present day.

65682	After completing a little more than 30 days of the social uprising in Chile, there are thousands of images that have been shared around the world showing how a people was able to wake up the sound of the students who taught us that "Evading" is a valid form of struggle and that with the pots and pans (for the cacerolazo), more than 1 million people can march freely in the shadow of new flags. 
65683	The phrase: "Because everything was stolen from us, even fear," is established as the only strategy of civil confrontation against the bullets of a repressive system that refuses to hear the sounds of the street. Choosing our own destiny is the basis of structural change that the first line is not willing to cross. 
65684	Chile changed in the course of a month and it has forever. 
65685	This is a tribute to those who died, were tortured, abused, disappeared and lost their sight in this struggle for social transformation. To all of them, their families and an entire country, our respect and commitment is shown through these images. 
65686	Multiple measures failed to control mis- and disinformation in Tunisia's 2019 elections · Global Voices 
65687	In spite of a generally low youth voter turnout, the increase in youth participation in the second round of presidential elections reignited the debate over the influence of the internet, and particularly social media, in the outcome. 
65688	In the months leading up to the elections, mis- and disinformation spread widely across social media platforms, on Facebook in particular. 
65689	Observers of the political scene noted the rise of political party- and candidate-affiliated Facebook groups and pages with substantial numbers of followers. 
65690	Pages without stated ties or affiliations were also actively involved in spreading political disinformation and sponsored content praising certain parties and candidates. 
65691	Read more: Ahead of Tunisia elections, social media was flooded with mis- and disinformation 
65692	Civil society groups, tech platforms, national institutions, and media professionals all adopted measures to counter the spread of mis- and disinformation during the electoral period. 
65693	However, in light of the lack of transparency on the part of tech platforms, and the legal void surrounding the regulation of political ads on social media, these measures proved insufficient. 
65694	Facebook's Ad Library: limited transparency 
65695	On September 2, the start date of the presidential election campaign, Access Now, along with 14 local civil society groups addressed an open letter to Facebook, asking the company “to implement effective measures for transparency and accountability towards users in the context of the upcoming Tunisian elections.” 
65696	The letters' signatories called on Facebook to take measures ‘’to allow voters to understand how political actors are using Facebook to influence election outcomes,’’ including by allowing public access to information about the number of ads sponsored, the amount of money spent on each ad campaign, the demographics of the targeted audience, and enforcing an ad authorization process on political advertisers. 
65697	Coordinated inauthentic activities targeting Tunisia on Facebook 
65698	On October 3rd, Facebook announced the removal of 163 Facebook accounts, 51 Pages, 33 Groups and 4 Instagram accounts that were involved in "coordinated inauthentic behavior" originating from Egypt targeting ten countries including Tunisia. 
65699	This is the third time this year that Facebook removes accounts involved in "inauthentic behavior" targeting Tunisia. 
65700	In May of this year, a press release announced the removal of accounts responsible for similar activity originated from Israel. 
65701	In January, the company removed 783 Pages, groups and accounts for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior tied to Iran targeting multiple countries including Tunisia. 
65702	Following the elections, Facebook responded to the open letter, stating that they have taken measures globally and in the MENA region to fight against misinformation, combat hate speech, and prevent foreign interference, AccessNow told Global Voices. 
65703	The company also said they had introduced a new authorization process for political and election-related ads in over 140 countries and territories, including Tunisia, and had made its ad library available in a number of countries outside the EU and North America, including Tunisia. 
65704	However, these measures are still not providing voters with sufficient information for them to understand who is trying to influence them and make informed decisions. 
65705	This lack of transparency also makes it harder for national institutions to oversee political ad spending. 
65706	“The level of information granularity provided to users appears to depend in which country the ad is running,” reported a Privacy International analysis published in October 2019. 
65707	Facebook says that political ads are archived in its Ad library for seven years. 
65708	However, Global Voices reviewed the ad libraries of three Facebook pages created in early September, at the start of the first round of the presidential election. 
65709	These unofficial Facebook pages are a subset of the many that supported then-presidential candidates Abdelfattah Mourou, Salma Elloumi and Abdelkarim Zbidi, and they all ran political ads during the campaign. 
65710	There are many other pages that supported the 23 other candidates that ran in the presidential election. 
65711	Today, the ad libraries of these three pages do not list any of their previous political ads.

65715	The library shows no record of the political ads posted during the presidential campaign.“The issue lies within the inability of Facebook to determine or distinguish between those pages that have political, cultural or social content,’’ Dima Samaro, MENA policy associate at Access Now told GV. 
65716	She explained: The Ad Library that Facebook has built failed to provide any measures of transparency, and has only been functioning on a few pages. 
65717	Ad Library of Facebook only shows the current running ads, but no details would be found on any of the previous/ non-current running ads, or even on any of those pages that have been taking down or its content.

65722	Legal framework shortage 
65723	The use of sponsored posts on Facebook also drew the scrutiny of the Independent High Authority for the Elections (ISIE). 
65724	Nabil Baffoun, ISIE’s president, pointed out in a press interview on October 7 that during an electoral campaign, the authority takes into account presidential candidates’ social media advertisements. 
65725	Electoral campaigns and their financing are subject to the provisions of the Tunisian Electoral Law. 
65726	In particular, Baffoun confirmed that sponsored pages appearing during the election campaign fall within the scope of Article 143 of the electoral law, which allows the ISIE and the Court of Auditors to impose sanctions for electoral violations, such as exceeding the spending limit and breaches of electoral silence. 
65727	In fact, on October 9, ISIE announced the cancellation of a portion of the votes obtained by the candidate of an electoral constituency representing the Tunisian diaspora in France, for breaching electoral silence through political advertisements on Facebook. 
65728	The commission said that the candidate of 3ich Tounsi, a registered non-profit organisation that filed non-partisan electoral lists during the elections, obtained 207 votes as a result of this advertisement, directly impacting the electoral results in the constituency. 
65729	No further explanation was given by the ISIE as to how this assessment was made. 
65730	This decision was criticized by candidates of the electoral list in question. 
65731	The Tunisian Association for the Integrity and Democracy of Elections (ATIDE) also called for the electoral commission to adopt transparent measures by publishing its reports monitoring the use of Facebook in relation to the elections. 
65732	ATIDE also called on the newly elected parliament to "put in place a decisive and comprehensive legal framework on social media advertising during the elections".

65736	In August, the electoral commission (ISIE) and the Independent High Authority for Audiovisual Communication (HAICA), the country's broadcast regulator, issued a joint decision comprising four chapters and 49 articles establishing the rules for media coverage of election campaigns. 
65737	These required local and foreign broadcast media covering the elections to respect the principles of equal opportunity and equity between candidates. 
65738	The rules did not apply to electronic media. 
65739	In partnership with the Council of Europe, HAICA also hosted capacity-building workshops as part of efforts to help media professionals develop the necessary skills to exercise their role in providing reliable and high-quality information. 
65740	Several fact-checking initiatives were also launched. 
65741	HAICA, along with the public broadcaster and the Tunisian Press Agency (TAP), launched a fact-checking platform dedicated to exposing misleading information spread online. 
65742	Privately-owned digital media websites also launched their own fact-checking initiatives. 
65743	A few months before the elections, Business News launched BNCheck, a fact-checking platform reporting that continues to operate. 
65744	Online magazine “L’Economiste Maghrébin” launched the #FactCheckTNDecides hashtag to verify statements and facts given by presidential candidates during televised presidential dabaes. 
65745	During a debate reflecting on L’Economiste Maghrébin's fact-checking experience, journalists highlighted the high financial costs of fact-checking, citing the need for additional recruitment, specialized software and training for journalists.

65755	On the evening of December 5, the streets and squares of the Czech Republic fill with unusual characters: devils, angels and saints wearing tall hats. 
65756	December 5 is eve of Saint Nicholas Day, and marks a special celebration for Czech children in the festive month of December. 
65757	Saint Nicholas was a 3rd-century Christian bishop born in the Greek city of Myra, now located in Turkey. 
65758	The Christian hagiography has added many legends to his biography over the centuries. 
65759	According to a rather gory one, a butcher kills three little children and pickles them in a barrel to sell as ham when Nicholas is passing through their city. 
65760	Sensing the treachery afoot, he resurrects the children. 
65761	This is perhaps among the main reasons that in the Czech Republic and other Central European countries, as well as in Belgium and the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas' festival is closely linked to children. 
65762	In the Czech tradition, Saint Nicholas walks the streets and sometimes knocks at doors, accompanied by an angel and a devil, and asks parents if their children have or have not behaved well that year. 
65763	If the report is positive, the angel pats the children and offers them treats. 
65764	Children who have misbehaved get a symbolic scolding from the devil. 
65765	The festival is considered a family affair, and many young people dress up as one of the three characters and roam the streets to entertain and/or scare children in a light-hearted way. 
65766	The feast has been so popular that it was widely observed in Czechoslovakia even during the Communist era, when public religious celebrations were banned, as it was considered to have partly pagan roots. 
65767	Today, it is celebrated by local municipalities, but "unofficial", spontaneous trios still walk around and keep the tradition alive. 
65768	Below are some photos taken in the evening of December 5, 2019, in Prague showing different ways in which Czechs marks the feast of Saint Nicholas.

65788	In Sudan, where the internet plays a crucial role in its political and economic transformation, net neutrality legislation still has a long way to go. 
65789	Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should treat all internet traffic equally, and not discriminate and charge differently based on users, content and applications. 
65790	In the broadest terms, it is about ensuring free and fair access to the internet through laws and policies that mitigate tensions between the private sector and the public good. 
65791	While there is no unified definition of the term, “most agree ... that owners of the networks that compose and provide access to the internet should not control how consumers lawfully use that network, and they should not be able to discriminate against content provider access to that network," according to a paper by Angele A. Gilroy, an academic. 
65792	Law professor Tim Wu first coined the term in 2003 in his paper, "Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination," in which he describes various tensions between the private sector and public interest groups. 
65793	As internet access becomes more accessible to a wider range of Sudanese citizens, a lack of net neutrality regulations means that violations in Sudan occur easily and often. 
65794	Violations of net neutrality come in many forms, such as "discrimination by protocol" when telecom companies and ISPs restrict or block access to certain sites or services by discriminating against certain communication protocols — for example, when ISPs block access to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications like WhatsApp, Skype and Viber. 
65795	In other cases, ISPs favor certain websites or applications by offering zero-rating plans that allow users to access them without counting it against their data caps or charging them for that access. 
65796	This discriminatory pricing bias gives some companies an unfair advantage over their competitors. 
65797	In Sudan, the main players in the telecoms market have been practicing zero-rating — a clear violation of the basic principles of net neutrality set by experts in the field that have since become accepted community norms. 
65798	MTN Sudan, a subsidiary of the South-African based MTN group, provides its users with access to Facebook Zero. 
65799	This service, which is part of an international project launched by Facebook in collaboration with mobile network providers, offers a stripped, text-only version of Facebook for free. 
65800	Another example was the Wikipedia Zero project offered by the telecom company Sudani, as part of the Wikipedia-zero program. 
65801	It offered access to the online encyclopedia free of charge through mobile phones. 
65802	The Wikipedia Zero program, which was slammed by advocates for violating net neutrality, was discontinued in 2018. 
65803	Zain Sudan, a subsidiary of the Kuwaiti Zain group, has been providing its users with access to Facebook’s Free Basics program, an app that gives users access to a handful of web-based services, the most recognizable and prominent of which is Facebook, according to this list. 
65804	2017 research by Global Voices found that Free Basics violated net neutrality and also granted Facebook access to unique streams of data about the habits and interests of users in developing countries. 
65805	Yet, Zain Sudan has recently promoted another offer called Flex that gives its users free access to Facebook and its messaging app, Messenger.

65808	Sudan does not yet have a law dedicated to net neutrality. 
65809	However, a few legal provisions in the 2018 Telecommunications and Postal Regulation Act indirectly address and tackle the issue. 
65810	Article 25 of the act prohibits any non-competitive activities by licensed companies. 
65811	Moreover, in what could be interpreted as an anti-zero-rating stance, Article 38 of the act criminalizes setting prices that discriminate between the users and also discounts that limit and restrict competition. 
65812	Another law that partially tackles the issue of network neutrality is the Organizing Competitiveness and Preventing monopoly Law of 2009. 
65813	Chapter two of this law prohibits giving any entity the privilege to distribute services or products based on market segmentation on a geographic basis, a specific time period or to favor certain customers over others. 
65814	In a country where the internet fueled a revolution and now drives the emergence of youth tech startups, leveling the playing field through net neutrality legislation is crucial. 
65815	This will help regulate economic competitors and also protect users’ rights to free and fair access to all services and apps. 
65816	Sudan could learn from countries like the Canada, India, and The Netherlands which have already set legal measures and laws to regulate telecom and ISP practices with respect to net neutrality. 
65817	Additionally, Sudan must strive for a cultural shift within civil society and the private sector to raise awareness and build incentives for defending net neutrality. 
65818	Why is Donald Trump so popular in Nigeria? · Global Voices

65821	United States President Donald Trump has received low ratings across the world for his handling of international affairs — but not in some African countries like Nigeria. 
65822	According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre most Nigerians "have confidence" that Trump "will do the right thing in world affairs." 
65823	The Pew survey results were gathered from telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted under the direction of Gallup — a Washington, DC, based analytics and advisory company. 
65824	An October 2019 Tweepsmap analysis of on Trump’s total followers on Twitter shows that Nigerians ranked in the top five across the world: 
65825	Except we want to live in denial, Trump is hugely popular in Nigeria. 
65826	Note, I am not his fan but truth be told, he has a huge fan base here. — Omadi (@iamtenseven) January 10, 2020 
65827	However, this does not explain why Trump is adored by some Nigerians. 
65828	Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani explained to The World, a public radio show co-produced by the BBC, that Trump's "tough guy image" strikes a chord in Africa's most populous country: 
65829	People admire his tough guy image and his bluntness is entertaining. 
65830	He's weird to Americans. He's strange. He's different from what you've had. 
65831	But we're used to leaders who speak without restraint, who are verbally abusive when they please. 
65832	And so, he's not as outlandish to us as he may appear to an American. 
65833	The other reason is religion. 
65834	Nigerian Christians love Trump. 
65835	Cheta Nwanze, Head of Research at SBM Intelligence told Global Voices: 
65836	I'd like to see exactly WHERE in Nigeria this survey was conducted. 
65837	I'm willing to bet that it was largely in southern Nigeria, which explains the love of Trump. 
65838	A lot of his base are evangelical Christians, from whom many Nigerians draw their inspiration. 
65839	Nigeria, with an estimated population of 200 million people, has two major religions: Christianity and Islam. 
65840	Muslims and Christians make up 50 percent and 48 percent of the Nigerian population respectively. 
65841	The methodology of the recent poll states that the study was conducted in Nigerian "local government areas stratified by geopolitical region." 
65842	However, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states in northwestern Nigeria were excluded from the study due to security concerns. 
65843	Nigeria has 774 local government areas, the grassroots arm of executive governance structure in the country. 
65844	There are also six geopolitical regions: North Central, Northwest, Northeast, South-south, Southeast, and Southwest. 
65845	Nwanze's position that Christians in southern Nigeria must have formed the core of the sample size for the Pew Research results are not unfounded. 
65846	The survey also showed that Nigerian Christians also "have a more favorable opinion of the US (69 percent) than do Muslims (54 percent)." 
65847	After the killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, by the United States, Nigeria's police chief issued a national security alert to forestall any disturbances by "domestic interests." 
65848	The Islamic movement in Nigeria described the US airstrike that killed Soleimani as a "declaration of war on Iran." 
65849	Trump has been described as "one of the most controversial world leaders in modern times." 
65850	Yet, he is clearly adored by many in Nigeria. 
65851	'An interplay between Western and Eastern Cultures': Two art exhibitions on cultural collisions · Global Voices 
65852	Negin Sharifzadeh, "Modern Girls, Ancient Rite," 2019, mounted museum print (1 of 3) 30’’ x 18.17’’ 
65853	Two women artists from Iran and Pakistan recently exhibited new bodies of work in New York, in which they portrayed the interplay between Western and Eastern cultures, evoking histories of iconography and the way women, in particular, are represented by others in canonical art history. 
65854	In an interview with Global Voices, the artists, Negin Sharifzadeh and Qinza Najm, stated that by using contemporary tools such as photography and animation they aimed to “question traditional narratives.” 
65855	In each case, the artists appropriated works from the Western canon, then inserted themselves in a tension of opposition and integration, subversion and homage, by claiming agency over their own bodies and the right to sit within positions of power inside art, history, and society. 
65856	'Appearance Stripped Bare' 
65857	Negin Sharifzadeh, a cross-disciplinary artist and storyteller based in Brooklyn, New York, received her BFA in sculpture from Tehran University in Iran in 2002, and her BFA in Performing Arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010. 
65858	In her show “Appearance Stripped Bare,” Sharifzadeh interrogates the concept of the European Renaissance as an isolated phenomenon rather than a period in organic conversation with movements that had started earlier in the Middle East. 
65859	In Italian Renaissance paintings such as "Annunciation," by Pierro Della Francesca and "Lamentation of Christ," by Andrea Mantegna, Sharifzadeh appears sometimes as Mary, sometimes as Jesus, sometimes as herself simply observing. 
65860	Negin Sharifzadeh, "When Caravaggio meets Gentileschi", 2019 Mounted Museum Print (1 of 3), 40’’ x 40’’ 
65861	“I have placed myself into photographic recreations of iconic paintings from the Italian Renaissance, creating works that are simultaneously homage and subversion, with the aim of exploring the impact of the broader Mediterranean culture, art and ideas that helped spark and inform Europe’s rebirth,” Sharifzadeh said. 
65862	“Too often," she added, "art historians have placed European arts in a position of privilege, exorcising and minimizing arts from the broader Mediterranean regions. 
65863	Through this re-contextualization and reclamation, I aim to challenge the very idea of European and Middle Eastern otherness.” 
65864	That re-contextualization and reclamation occur as Sharifzadeh places her own contemporary, Middle Eastern, female body within the imagery, iconography, and physical geography of the Italian Renaissance. 
65865	Her work is also a commentary on present-day cultural collisions. 
65866	“Negin’s point of view, influenced by her Iranian identity and her American life, is very remarkable as it is able to inspire a sense of dialogue and reconciliation, very precious in the current political turmoil,” said curator Giulio Verago, director of Via Farini Artists-in-Residence in Milan. 
65867	“The use of irony, especially in a time of great depression and disillusion, celebrates the freedom of artistic expression. 
65868	She takes into account the divergences in the representation of the female body between East and West—how, for instance, the influence of classical representation of female nudity gave shape somehow to the way we see women’s bodies and women’s desires and ambitions nowadays.” 
65869	Negin Sharifzadeh, "Anodyne (Triptych)", 2019 Mounted Museum Print (1 of 3) 40’’ x 28.65’’ 
65870	Sharifzadeh said that she has brought lots of questions to the forefront about the exchange of art and architecture between the Italian Renaissance and its broader Mediterranean Ottoman Empire. 
65871	“Hopefully, these conversations will make my audience more curious about that specific era with the silver lining that our interconnectedness through arts and culture has been a phenomenon throughout history.” 
65872	'Still, I Rise' 
65873	Pakistani-American Qinza Najm, born and raised in Lahore, pursued her studies in fine arts at Bath University in the UK and The Art Students League of New York. 
65874	Originally trained as a psychologist, Najm uses performance, video, painting, and other mediums to create empathy and understanding between societies and cultures in order to address the deepest social traumas. 
65875	Drawing from a broad swath of art history, Najm uses a wide range of techniques to “break the frame.” 
65876	For instance, her “stretched carpets” works take the Persian-style rug, ubiquitous across much of the Middle East, and emblazons the carpets with elongated female figures that explore the contradictions and cultural clash between contemporary life and the reactionary traditional world. 
65877	One powerful work in the show, based on an earlier performance piece, was "Veil of Bullets," which depicts Najm encased in a 40-pound veil made of a fishnet and 1,100-plus empty bullet casings representing both the honor killings in Pakistan during the previous year as well as the 1,100 children and adults killed during school shootings in the United States. 
65878	"Story of Rashida," photo in a lightbox, 17×11 inch each, 2017-18, by Qinza Najm. 
65879	In another series, "The Story of Rashida," Najm explicitly explores gendered violence and female subjectivity. 
65880	She does this using photos of her own mother, cousins and friends holding quotidian household objects—from cheese graters to scissors—that have been used against women as tools of domestic violence in Pakistan, a country where honor killings are still a pervasive and sanctioned practice. 
65881	The exhibition’s title, “Still, I Rise,” refers to a poem by Maya Angelou that celebrates female empowerment in the context of slavery and black culture. 
65882	Curator Tami Katz Freiman explained that “Najm chose words that promise redemption, thus endowing her personal story with a universal feminist context, while also attending to the themes of empathy, generosity, transformation and change.” 
65883	“Her fluid movement," Freiman added, "between different disciplines is illustrated in this exhibition which features a selection from four bodies of work that resonate with one another.” 
65884	“I am interested in the body as both medium and subject—the circumstances surrounding its physical occupation of space, the norms and laws that govern bodies as political subjects, and the uneven burden these norms often place on women and minorities,” writes Najm in her statement for the exhibition, adding that, “drawing from my upbringing in Lahore, Pakistan, and adulthood in the United States, my sculptures, installations, and performances address gender politics, displacement and cultural power through lenses of geography and social identification." 
65885	In her art Najm says she often uses “…motifs of bodies stretched, deconstructed, distorted, and pushed beyond their limits. 
65886	A manipulated body is a reflection of how power is exerted on our being. 
65887	However, I am more interested in the depiction of human potential—an extended body claims space beyond its expected role, both physically and figuratively. 
65888	In particular, I aim to raise questions about how we might transcend and combat cultural stereotypes, prejudice, displacement and sexist norms.” 
65889	"Veil of Bullets," 66×44 inch, Print on Aluminum, 2019, by Qinza Najm, 
65890	Najm told Global Voices that the theme of violence is universal, and possibly it can bring us together through the empathy and compassion that is currently missing in the international dialogue of the East and the West, dividing narratives and what media portrays, especially between the U.S. and Islamic countries. 
65891	“This exhibition and the conversation the came out of the exhibition is giving me material to take the dialogue of this exhibition further,” she emphasized. 
65892	“I am excited to see what comes out of it and I like to surprise myself through taking more risk and experimentation.” 
65893	Both “Appearance Stripped Bare” and “Still, I Rise” evoked histories of iconography and the way women, in particular, are presented by others in canonical art history. 
65894	The artists are reclaiming this representation as a site of power, using the contemporary tools of photography and animation to question those traditional narratives. 
65895	Both shows powerfully interrogated the role of women across the boundaries between Western and Eastern cultures and, through their art, claimed an agency over their own bodies and their right to sit within positions of power inside art, history, and society. 
65896	The two exhibitions took place at the A.I.R. gallery in October 2019, Brooklyn, New York.

65899	Prominent Tunisian blogger and human rights defender Lina Ben Mhenni passed away at the age of 36 on Monday 27 January, 2020. 
65900	Prior to the regime’s collapse, she blogged and wrote about the human rights situation in the country on her award-winning blog, A Tunisian Girl. 
65901	She was also a contributor to Global Voices, where she wrote extensively about internet censorship, the crackdown on bloggers and freedom of expression under the Ben Ali regime. 
65902	Lina continued her tireless activism after the revolution. She was critical of the rule of the Islamist Ennahdha movement, which governed with two other parties from late 2011 and early 2014. During this period, violations of human rights and individual freedoms continued to take place, including on religious grounds. 
65903	Ben Mhenni also received death threats for her criticism of the Islamists and the authorities. 
65904	Ben Mhenni also campaigned for the socio-economic and cultural rights of all Tunisians. 
65905	She was a strong supporter of the rights of those who were injured for protesting during the revolution, including their right to compensation and adequate healthcare. 
65906	In 2016, along with her father Sadok Ben Mhenni, a political activist and human rights defender who was imprisoned under the regime of Bourguiba (Tunisia’s post-independence president), she started a campaign to collect books for prisoners to help fight radicalization in prisons. 
65907	They collected more than 45,000 books in two years. 
65908	The award-winning blogger died of a chronic illness that required her to have a kidney transplant in 2007. 
65909	Speaking to a local radio station on 14 February 2019, Lina paid tribute to her mother for donating her kidney to her and for supporting her activism. She said: 
65910	Thanks to her I got to live another 12 years I may not have lived, or I would have lived a prisoner in my own body. But I have fully lived these years thanks to her. 
65911	I travelled, I moved, I filmed, I ran, I screamed, and I lived the Tunisian revolution, something I may not have been able to live… 
65912	Is Trump's Middle East peace plan a one-state solution? · Global Voices

65915	On Tuesday, January 28, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his long-awaited Middle East peace plan known as the “deal of the century.” 
65916	The plan calls for a separate Palestinian state and promises Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital. 
65917	According to Trump's plan, a Palestinian state will only be realized if Palestinians meet demands made by Israel. 
65918	Palestinians widely rejected the plan before it was even announced. 
65919	So, what is the new peace plan? 
65920	The plan includes a “conceptual map” that shows territorial compromises that Israel is making to accommodate a Palestinian state. 
65921	According to the BBC, Trump added that the map "more than doubles the Palestinian territory and provide a Palestinian capital in eastern Jerusalem." 
65922	The U.S. would open an embassy in the “new Palestinian state.” 
65923	"No Palestinians or Israelis will be uprooted from their homes," Trump said in his speech. 
65924	He added that the existing Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank — illegal according to international law — will remain. 
65925	He said that territory allocated to Palestinians "will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years." 
65926	During those four years, Palestinians "can study the deal, negotiate with Israel, and achieve the criteria for statehood," according to the BBC. 
65927	Finally, "Israel will work with the king of Jordan to ensure that the status quo governing the key holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and al-Haram al-Sharif to Muslims is preserved," according to the BBC. 
65928	The plan asserts that the current physical separation barrier between Israel and Palestine should remain and will be considered the border between the "two states." 
65929	Over the decades, the U.S has attempted to mediate between Israel and Palestine to create what is known as a "two-state solution" where both Israelis and Palestinians live independently. 
65930	On Twitter, Shahed Amanullah compared the plan to the United States' Native American reservations: 
65931	This doesn't look like a state. 
65932	Following the announcement, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said that Israel is free to annex settlements at any given time. 
65933	Hours later, Netanyahu’s spokesman Jonathan Urich announced on Twitter that the prime minister will ask the cabinet to back the full annexation of settlements in the West Bank on Sunday. 
65934	The following tweet shows the changes over time in the proportions of the land in Palestine versus the Israeli settlements: 
65935	The PLO does not agree with the math... pic.twitter.com/LyyltDgJAY — Mariya Petkova (@mkpetkova) January 28, 2020 
65936	A 'farce,' a 'sham,' a 'disgrace' 
65937	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, — who is also indicted on corruption charges in Israel, — stood at the White House in Washington, D.C. alongside Trump while he made the announcement. 
65938	Ambassadors of Egypt and Jordan — the only Arab countries that have a peace treaty with Israel, — were both absent. 
65939	"My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security," Trump said during his speech. 
65940	Political analyst Marwan Bishara called the plan a “farce" on Twitter, given that both Trump and Netanyahu facing charges in their respective countries and aim to redirect attention away from that. 
65941	As Trump made his peace plan announcement, his defense team was in the Senate battling his impeachment. 
65942	Meanwhile, hours earlier, Netanyahu was formally indicted on corruption charges.

65944	The plan has been highly criticized as an endorsement for the unilateral Israeli annexation of the settlements. 
65945	When was the last time anyone made an agreement about a third party, with the third party not present? 
65946	Arab states have called for a conversation that includes all parties to reach an agreement. 
65947	Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Jordan has said that establishing an independent state of Palestine is the only route for peace in the region. 
65948	Want to know why this "ultimate deal" is a sham & a disgrace that will never lead to peace?
