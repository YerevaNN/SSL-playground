339694	BG: I think that right now, many people are asking, "When are you developing a double-seater so they can fly with you?"
339695	YR: I have a standard answer.
339696	Have you ever seen tandem birds? (Laughter)
339697	(Applause ends) BG: Yves, one last question.
339698	What's next for you?
339699	What's next for Jetman?
339700	YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.
339701	I want to share it, to do formation flights.
339702	And I plan to start from a cliff, like catapulted from a cliff.
339703	BG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?
339704	YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off, but with initial speed.
339705	Really, I go step by step.
339706	It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.
339707	It's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous.
339708	(Laughter) Thanks to the increasing technology, better technology, it will be safe.
339709	And I hope it will be for everybody.
339710	BG: Yves, thank you very much.
339711	Yves Rossy.
339712	(Applause)
339713	It's 1996 in Uvira in eastern Congo.
339714	This is Bukeni.
339715	Militia commanders walk into his village, knock on his neighbors' doors and whisk their children away to training camps.
339716	Bukeni borrows a video camera from a local wedding photographer, he disguises as a journalist and he walks into the camps to negotiate the release of the children. He filmed footage of the children being trained as soldiers.
339717	[Free beans!] Many of these children are under 15 years old, and that is a war crime.
339718	But you don't have to go to eastern Congo to find human rights abuses. In America, a country with a rapidly aging population, experts estimate that one in 10 people over 60 will experience abuse.
339719	It's a hidden epidemic, and most of that abuse actually happens at the hands of close caretakers or family.
339720	Vicky put an iron gate on her bedroom door and she became a prisoner, in fact, in her own house, out of fear for her nephew who had taken over her home as a drug den.
339721	Mary picked up a video camera for the first time in her life when she was 65 years old, and she asked Vicky and 99 other older people who had experienced abuse to tell their stories on camera.
339722	And I am Dutch, so in the Netherlands we are obsessed with the truth. Now, when you are a child, that's a great thing, because you can basically get away with anything, like "Yes, Mama, it was me who smoked the cigars."
339723	(Laughter)
339724	But I think this is why I have dedicated my life to promoting citizen video to expose human rights violations, because I believe in the power of video to create undeniable truths.
339725	And my organization, WITNESS, helped use the Congolese videos to help convict and send a notorious warlord called Thomas Lubanga to jail.
339726	And the videos that Mary shot, we trained Mary and many other elder justice advocates, to make sure that the stories of elder abuse reached lawmakers, and those stories helped convince lawmakers to pass landmark legislation to protect older Americans.
339727	So I wonder, billions of us now have this powerful tool right at our fingertips.
339728	It's a camera.
339729	So why are all of us not a more powerful army of civic witnesses, like Mary and Bukeni?
339730	Why is it that so much more video is not leading to more rights and more justice?
339731	And I think it is because being an eyewitness is hard. Your story will get denied, your video will get lost in a sea of images, your story will not be trusted, and you will be targeted.
339732	So how do we help witnesses?
339733	In Oaxaca, in Mexico, the teachers' movement organized a protest after the president pushed down very undemocratic reforms. The federal police came down in buses and started shooting at the protesters.
339734	But we had just trained activists in Mexico to use metadata strategically with their images.
339735	Now, metadata is the kind of information that your camera captures that shows the date, the location, the temperature, the weather.
339736	It can even show the very unique way you hold your camera when you capture something.
339737	So the images started recirculating, and this time with the very verifying, validating information on top of them.
339738	And the federal government had to retract their statement.
339739	Now, justice for the people for Oaxaca is still far off, but their stories, their truths, can no longer be denied.
339740	So we started thinking: What if you had "Proof Mode?" What if everybody had a camera in their hands and all the platforms had that kind of validating ability.
339741	So we developed — together with amazing Android developers called the Guardian Project, we developed something called a technology that's called Proof Mode, that marries those metadata together with your image, and it validates and it verifies your video.
339742	Now, imagine there is a deluge of images coming from the world's camera phones.
339743	Imagine if that information could be trusted just a little bit more, what the potential would be for journalists, for human rights investigators, for human rights lawyers.
339744	So we started sharing Proof Mode with our partners in Brazil who are an amazing media collective called Coletivo Papo Reto.
339745	Brazil is a tough place for human rights.
339746	The Brazilian police kills thousands of people every year.
339747	The only time that there's an investigation, guess when?
339748	When there's video.
339749	Seventeen-year-old Eduardo was killed in broad daylight by the Rio police, and look what happens after they kill him. They put a gun in the dead boy's hand, they shoot the gun twice —
339750	(Shot)
339751	to fabricate their story of self-defense.
339752	The woman who filmed this was a very, very courageous eyewitness, and she had to go into hiding after she posted her video for fear of her life.
339753	But people are filming, and they're not going to stop filming, so we're now working together with media collectives so the residents on their WhatsApp frequently get guidance and tips, how to film safely, how to upload the video that you shoot safely, how to capture a scene so that it can actually count as evidence.
339754	And here is an inspiration from a group called Mídia Ninja in Brazil. The man on left is a heavily armed military policeman.
339755	He walks up to a protester — when you protest in Brazil, you can be arrested or worse — and he says to the protester, "Watch me, I am going to search you right now." And the protester is a live-streaming activist — he wears a little camera — and he says to the military policeman, he says, "I am watching you, and there are 5,000 people watching you with me." Now, the tables are turned.
339756	The distant witnesses, the watching audience, they matter.
339757	So we started thinking, what if you could tap into that power, the power of distant witnesses?
339758	What if you could pull in their expertise, their leverage, their solidarity, their skills when a frontline community needs them to be there?
339759	And we started developing a project that's called Mobilize Us, because many of us, I would assume, want to help and lend our skills and our expertise, but we are often not there when a frontline community or a single individual faces an abuse.
339760	And it could be as simple as this little app that we created that just shows the perpetrator on the other side of the phone how many people are watching him.
339761	But now, imagine that you could put a layer of computer task routing on top of that.
339762	Imagine that you're a community facing an immigration raid, and at that very moment, at that right moment, via livestream, you could pull in a hundred legal observers.
339763	How would that change the situation?
339764	So we started piloting this with our partner communities in Brazil.
339765	This is a woman called Camilla, and she was able — she's the leader in a favela called Favela Skol — she was able to pull in distant witnesses via livestream to help translation, to help distribution, to help amplify her story after her community was forcibly evicted to make room for a very glossy Olympic event last summer.
339766	So we're talking about good witnessing, but what happens if the perpetrators are filming?
339767	What happens if a bystander films and doesn't do anything?
339768	This is the story of Chrissy.
339769	Chrissy is a transgender woman who walked into a McDonald's in Maryland to use the women's bathroom.
339770	Two teens viciously beat her for using that woman's bathroom, and the McDonald's employee filmed this on his mobile phone.
339771	And he posted his video, and it has garnered thousands of racist and transphobic comments.
339772	So we started a project that's called Capturing Hate.
339773	We took a very, very small sample of eyewitness videos that showed abuse against transgender and gender-nonconforming people. We searched two words, "tranny fight" and "stud fight." And those 329 videos were watched and are still being watched as we sit here in this theater, a stunning almost 90 million times, and there are hundreds of thousands of comments with these videos, egging on to more violence and more hate.
339774	So we started developing a methodology that took all that unquantified visual evidence and turned it into data, turning video into data, and with that tool, LGBT organizations are now using that data to fight for rights.
339775	And we take that data and we take it back to Silicon Valley, and we say to them: "How is it possible that these videos are still out there in a climate of hate egging on more hate, summoning more violence, when you have policies that actually say you do not allow this kind of content? — urging them to change their policies.
339776	So I have hope.
339777	I have hope that we can turn more video into more rights and more justice.
339778	Ten billion video views on Snapchat, per day.
339779	So what if we could turn that Snapchat generation into effective and safe civic witnesses?
339780	What if they could become the Bukenis of this new generation?
339781	In India, women have already started using Snapchat filters to protect their identity when they speak out about domestic violence.
339782	[They tortured me at home and never let me go out.] The truth is, the real truth, the truth that doesn't fit into any TED Talk, is fighting human rights abuse is hard.
339783	There are no easy solutions for human rights abuse.
339784	And there's not a single piece of technology that can ever stop the perpetrators.
339785	But for the survivors, for the victims, for the marginalized communities, their stories, their truths, matter.
339786	And that is where justice begins.
339787	Thank you.
339788	(Applause)
339789	There are 27 houses for six, seven people each. There's a small mall with a restaurant, a pub, a supermarket, a club room.
339790	Dementia is a terrible disease, and we still don't have any cure for it. It's getting to be a major problem in the world, for the people, for the politicians, for the world — it's getting to be a big problem.
339791	Most people that come to the nursing homes with dementia are women. And that's also because women are used to taking care of people, so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia, but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.
339792	They're very confused. And because of that confusion, they get to be anxious, depressed, aggressive.
339793	And we often spoke together about the fact that what we were doing there was not what we wanted for our parents, for our friends, for ourselves. And one day, we said, "When we keep on saying this, nothing is going to change.
339794	We are in charge here. We should do something about this, so that we do want to have our parents here."
339795	We talked about that, and what we saw every day was that the people that lived in our nursing home were confused about their environment, because what they saw was a hospital-like environment, with doctors and nurses and paramedics in uniform, and they lived on a ward. And they didn't understand why they lived there.
339796	They wanted to have a normal household, where they would smell their dinner on the stove in the kitchen. Or be free to go to the kitchen and grab something to eat or drink.
339797	And we should find a way to select people based on their ideas about life so that they did have a good chance to become friends, when they lived together. And we interviewed all the families of the residents about "what is important for your father," "what's important for your mother," "what is their life like," "what do they want." And we found seven groups, and we call them lifestyle groups.
339798	Classical music is more heard in this lifestyle group than in other lifestyle groups. And their menu, well, is more French cuisine than traditional Dutch.
339799	(Laughter)
339800	That's a very traditional lifestyle, and they get up early in the morning, go to bed early, because they have worked hard their whole life, mostly with their hands, very often had a very small family business, a small farm, a shop, or like Mr. B, he was a farmhand. And he told me that he would go to his work every morning with a paper bag with his lunch and one cigar.
339801	She's of the cultural lifestyle, she's been living in the Hogeweyk six weeks now. And that lifestyle is about traveling, meeting other people, other cultures, interest in arts and music.
339802	But that's not life in a house with a group of people, like-minded people, your own life, your own household. There's more in life, everybody wants fun in life and a meaningful life.
339803	(Laughter)
339804	And he's very courteous to them, and he hopes for smiles and he gets them. And he dances with them in the pub.
339805	There are people that would rather go to the restaurant, have a wine with friends, or lunch or dinner with friends and celebrate life. And my mother, she takes a walk in the park, and sits on a bench in the sun, hoping that a passerby will come and sit next to her and have a conversation about life or about the ducks in the pond.
339806	That social life is important. It means that you're part of society, that you belong.
339807	And now and then, I tried to have a conversation with them, but their conversation was ... rather hard to understand. But I saw them meeting, and I saw them talking, and I saw them gesturing.
339808	The Hogeweyk has become a place where people with very advanced dementia can live, have freedom and safety, because the professionals working there and the volunteers working there know how to deal with dementia. And the professionals know how to do their professional work in a way that it fits in a natural way in the life of our residents.
339809	We think this can be done everywhere, because this is not for the rich. We've been doing this with the same budget as any traditional nursing home has in our country.
339810	(Applause)
339811	Because it has to do with thinking different, and looking at the person in front of you and looking at what does this person need now. And it's about a smile, it's about thinking different, it's about how you act, and that costs nothing.
339812	(Laughter)
339813	It's possible, everywhere.
339814	Thank you.
339815	(Applause)
339816	Like many of you, I'm often frustrated by the democratic process.
339817	It's messy, it's complicated, it's often inefficient.
339818	Our political leaders feel disconnected from the concerns of ordinary people.
339819	Many feel that voting every few years for leaders disconnected from their daily challenges is pointless.
339820	But before we reject democracy, let's imagine what it could be.
339821	And I believe that African activists are redefining democracy by putting protest at its center, what I refer to as "protest democracy."
339822	International organizations and academic experts define democracy as regular, multiparty electoral competition.
339823	But democracy should not only be about elites competing at the ballot box.
339824	For it to have meaning, it's something we must engage in every day.
339825	When I say "protest democracy," I'm challenging how we think about democratic action.
339826	Viewing democracy as only elections is no longer adequate and threatens democracy itself.
339827	So we must protest democracy to give it a renewed meaning.
339828	What would this look like?
339829	We need to turn to African societies, where ordinary people are increasingly taking to the streets to transform their lives.
339830	African social movements have often been at the forefront of conceptualizing democracy in this way.
339831	This may come as a surprise to those of who think that the only way Africans engage in politics is through the barrel of the gun.
339832	But increasingly, young people are taking to the streets and abandoning organized violence in favor of more effective nonviolent action.
339833	I've spent much of the past two decades talking to African activists, both violent and nonviolent.
339834	Across Africa, young people are rising up to challenge almost every type of regime known to humanity.
339835	This is my friend Thiat.
339836	He's a rapper from Senegal.
339837	He led a large movement in Senegal that was successful in preventing the president from stealing a third term.
339838	From Morocco to Lesotho, young people are rising up against entrenched monarchies: in Egypt and Sudan, against brutal dictatorships; in Uganda and Ethiopia, against powerful militarized states with quasi-democratic veneers; in South Africa, where this image was taken, and Burundi, against democratically elected leaders who have done little to improve the conditions for ordinary people.
339839	Across the continent, protest is not exceptional, but a normal part of life.
339840	Africans use protests to challenge both dictators as well as power cuts.
339841	In a way, Africans are protesting democracy itself, enriching its possibilities for us all.
339842	There have been two major waves of African protest, and we are currently living through the third, which began around 2005.
339843	It includes the so-called Arab Spring, which took place mostly on the continent.
339844	The first wave took place in the 1940s and 1950s and led to Africa's decolonization.
339845	Kwame Nkrumah led a broad coalition in Ghana that overthrew British rule, providing a template for nonviolent movements globally.
339846	The second wave took place in the 1980s and 1990s against austerity measures that imposed harsh conditions on African economies.
339847	These protests led to the overthrow of autocratic regimes and led to the introduction of multiparty elections across the continent.
339848	The ongoing third wave is correcting the shortcomings of the earlier two.
339849	If the first wave brought liberation but not democracy, and the second, elections but only for the elites, then it is the third wave that is most concerned with transforming democracy into the rule of the people.
339850	It includes movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal, Le Balai Citoyen in Burkina Faso, Tajamuka in Zimbabwe, LUCHA and Filimbi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, movements that work outside of more conventional nongovernmental organizations and political parties to challenge the economic and political system itself, often at great risk.
339851	Brilliant young activists like LUCHA's Fred Bauma have been detained and tortured, often with little to no outcry from the international community.
339852	The list goes on, as you can see from some of the data we collected.
339853	There have been large popular protests in over 40 African countries since 2005, and if you look, you'll recognize that in 2011, the year of the so-called Arab Spring, was actually the spike of this broader wave.
339854	Contrary to popular belief, many of these protests have been successful.
339855	We know of the dictators falling in Tunisia and in Egypt, but popular movements have prevented presidents from stealing third terms in Senegal, in Malawi and Burkina Faso as well.
339856	What's driving this upsurge of protest?
339857	Demographically, Africa is both the youngest and the fastest-growing continent, with the largest age gap between the people and their rulers.
339858	It is urbanizing at a tremendous pace.
339859	Economically, African countries have been growing for over a decade now, largely driven by investments from Asia.
339860	But little of this wealth is trickling down.
339861	Formal jobs in the industrial sector are actually decreasing, with informal labor the only option left for people to eke out a living.
339862	As a result, inequality is skyrocketing, and political leaders are increasingly disconnected from their much younger populations.
339863	For those of us from outside of Africa, we're familiar with parts of this story: a massive spike in inequality, the product of a decline in good jobs for good wages that were once considered the hallmark of an advanced society; the capture of our political parties by elites accompanied by the hollowing out of civil society that once provided a voice to ordinary people; that sinking feeling that no matter what you do, external factors related to the global economy can disrupt our lives for the worse.
339864	Our political leaders seem helpless, insisting on austerity, even as public goods diminish to levels unseen in decades.
339865	And this is when they're not succumbing to exclusionary nationalism, blaming our woes on the weak rather than the powerful.
339866	What those of us from North America and Western Europe consider to be new has been the normal condition of African life since the 1970s.
339867	So who better to learn from than those who have been engaged in resistance to these conditions for the longest period of time?
339868	What can we learn from African protest democracy?
339869	First, democracy must begin with ordinary people.
339870	Viewing democracy as only elections has led to widespread disillusionment.
339871	We must instead work to center ordinary people in democratic life.
339872	Protest provides us one way to do that.
339873	Regardless of your age, sexuality, your gender, whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen, able-bodied or disabled, anyone can participate.
339874	In contrast to elections, protests are not confined by rigid electoral cycles.
339875	They offer a much more immediate form of action in our era of instant feedback.
339876	Second, while protests may be messy, this is what makes them powerful.
339877	Protests are contentious and contested processes, defined by contingent actions, often devoid of clear messaging, characterized by incomplete organization.
339878	These dynamics are what makes it easy to dismiss protests as riots or to assume they are of limited political utility.
339879	But it also makes them easier to suppress.
339880	Too often, governments do not view protests as elementary to democracy.
339881	Instead, they violently crush social movements or work to discredit their message.
339882	Third, as I already hinted, protest is the space from which new political imaginations may emerge. Protests are about coloring outside the lines, a way for ordinary people to rewrite the rules of the game that too many feel are stacked against them.
339883	Many young people in Africa have grown up in societies where a single ruler has ruled their entire lives.
339884	Protest is the space for new possibilities to emerge, as young people begin to discover their own power.
339885	Consider the situation of my friend Linda Masarira, a single mother of five, who is leading protests against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.
339886	She has been beaten, arrested, harassed.
339887	But Linda perseveres, because as she told me a few months ago, protest has given her a sense of meaning and direction.
339888	And though she knows the odds against her, Linda perseveres.
339889	Like Linda and other young African activists, we all must work to redefine democracy as something more than just elections and political parties.
339890	Democracy is a creative process, and protest has always been the vehicle for expanding our political imaginations beyond what we are told is possible.
339891	(In Swahili) Thank you very much.
339892	(Applause)
339893	In 1994, Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein coauthored "The Bell Curve," an extremely controversial book which claims that on average, some races are smarter and more likely to succeed than others. Murray and Herrnstein also suggest that a lack of critical intelligence explains the prominence of violent crime in poor African-American communities.
339894	But Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein are not the only people who think this.
339895	In 2012, a writer, journalist and political commentator named John Derbyshire wrote an article that was supposed to be a non-black version of the talk that many black parents feel they have to give their kids today: advice on how to stay safe. In it, he offered suggestions such as: "Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks," "Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods" and "Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in distress." And yet, in 2016, I invited John Derbyshire as well as Charles Murray to speak at my school, knowing full well that I would be giving them a platform and attention for ideas that I despised and rejected.
339896	But this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life.
339897	When I was 10 years old, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by mood swings and paranoid delusions.
339898	Throughout my life, my mother's rage would turn our small house into a minefield.
339899	Yet, though I feared her rage on a daily basis, I also learned so much from her.
339900	Our relationship was complicated and challenging, and at the age of 14, it was decided that I needed to live apart from her.
339901	But over the years, I've come to appreciate some of the important lessons my mother taught me about life.
339902	She was the first person who spoke to me about learning from the other side.
339903	And she, like me, was born and raised in a family of committed liberal democrats.
339904	Yet, she encouraged me to see the world and the issues our world faces as complex, controversial and ever-changing.
339905	One day, I came across the phrase "affirmative action" in a book I was reading.
339906	And when I asked her what the term meant, she spent what felt like an hour giving me a thorough and thoughtful explanation that would make sense to a small child.
339907	She even made the topic sound at least as interesting as any of my professors have.
339908	She explained the many reasons why people of various political views challenge and support affirmative action, stressing that, while she strongly supported it herself, it was important for me to view the issue as a controversial one with a long history, a questionable future and a host of complicating factors.
339909	While affirmative action can increase the presence of minorities at elite educational institutions, she felt that it could also disadvantage hardworking people of different races from more affluent backgrounds.
339910	My mom wanted me to understand that I should never just write off opinions that I disagreed with or disliked, because there was always something to learn from the perspectives of others, even when doing so might be difficult.
339911	But life at home with my mom was not the only aspect of my journey that has been formative and uncomfortable.
339912	In fourth grade, she decided that I should attend a private school in order to receive the best education possible.
339913	As a black student attending predominantly white private schools, I've encountered attitudes and behaviors that reflected racial stereotypes. Several of my friends' parents assumed within minutes of meeting me that my best skill was playing basketball.
339914	And it really upset me to think that my race made it harder for them to see me as a student who loved reading, writing and speaking.
339915	Experiences like this motivated me to work tirelessly to disprove what I knew people had assumed.
339916	My mother even said that, in order to put my best foot forward, I had to be patient, alert and excruciatingly well-mannered.
339917	To prove that I belonged, I had to show poise and confidence, the ability to speak well and listen closely.
339918	Only then would my peers see that I deserved to be there as much as they did.
339919	Despite this racial stereotyping and the discomfort I often felt, the learning I gained from other aspects of being at an elite private school were incredibly valuable.
339920	I was encouraged by my teachers to explore my curiosity, to challenge myself in new ways and to deepen my understanding of subjects that fascinated me the most.
339921	And going to college was the next step.
339922	I was excited to take my intellectual drive and interest in the world of ideas to the next level.
339923	I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors and with outside speakers; to listen, to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself and of others.
339924	While I was fortunate to meet peers and professors who were interested in doing the same thing, my desire to engage with difficult ideas was also met with resistance.
339925	To prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world, I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus.
339926	But many people fiercely opposed this group, and I received significant pushback from students, faculty and my administration.
339927	For many, it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable, when they caused harm.
339928	And it was disappointing to me facing personal attacks, having my administration cancel speakers and hearing my intentions distorted by those around me.
339929	My work also hurt the feelings of many, and I understood that.
339930	Of course, no one likes being offended, and I certainly don't like hearing controversial speakers argue that feminism has become a war against men or that blacks have lower IQs than whites.
339931	I also understand that some people have experienced traumatic experiences in their lives.
339932	And for some, listening to offensive views can be like reliving the very traumas that they've worked so hard to overcome.
339933	Many argue that by giving these people a platform, you're doing more harm than good, and I'm reminded of this every time I listen to these points of view and feel my stomach turn.
339934	Yet, tuning out opposing viewpoints doesn't make them go away, because millions of people agree with them.
339935	In order to understand the potential of society to progress forward, we need to understand the counterforces.
339936	By engaging with controversial and offensive ideas, I believe that we can find common ground, if not with the speakers themselves, then with the audiences they may attract or indoctrinate.
339937	Through engaging, I believe that we may reach a better understanding, a deeper understanding, of our own beliefs and preserve the ability to solve problems, which we can't do if we don't talk to each other and make an effort to be good listeners.
339938	But soon after I announced that John Derbyshire would be speaking on campus, student backlash erupted on social media.
339939	The tide of resistance, in fact, was so intense, that my college president rescinded the invitation.
339940	I was deeply disappointed by this because, as I saw it, there would be nothing that any of my peers or I could do to silence someone who agreed with him in the office environment of our future employers.
339941	I look out at what's happening on college campuses, and I see the anger.
339942	And I get it.
339943	But what I wish I could tell people is that it's worth the discomfort, it's worth listening, and that we're stronger, not weaker, because of it.
339944	When I think about my experiences with uncomfortable learning, and I reflect upon them, I've found that it's been very difficult to change the values of the intellectual community that I've been a part of.
339945	But I do feel a sense of hope when I think about the individual interactions that I've been able to have with students who both support the work that I'm doing and who feel challenged by it and who do not support it.
339946	What I've found is that, while it can be difficult to change the values of a community, we can gain a lot from individual interactions.
339947	While I didn't get to engage with John Derbyshire due to my president's disinvitation, I was able to have dinner with Charles Murray before his talk.
339948	I knew the conversation would be difficult.
339949	And I didn't expect it to be pleasant.
339950	But it was cordial, and I did gain a deeper understanding of his arguments.
339951	I found that he, like me, believed in creating a more just society.
339952	The thing is, his understanding of what justice entailed was very different from my own.
339953	The way in which he wanted to understand the issue, the way in which he wanted to approach the issue of inequality also differed from my own.
339954	And I found that his understanding of issues like welfare and affirmative action was tied and deeply rooted in his understanding of various libertarian and conservative beliefs, what diminishes and increases their presence in our society.
339955	While he expressed his viewpoints eloquently, I remained thoroughly unconvinced.
339956	But I did walk away with a deeper understanding.
339957	It's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of adversity, we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity.
339958	I'd like to see a world with more leaders who are familiar with the depths of the views of those they deeply disagree with, so that they can understand the nuances of everyone they're representing.
339959	I see this as an ongoing process involving constant learning, and I'm confident that I'll be able to add value down the line if I continue building empathy and understanding through engaging with unfamiliar perspectives.
339960	Thank you.
339961	(Applause)
339962	Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
339963	We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties.
339964	Over the last three years, we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED.
339965	Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding.
339966	It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech.
339967	Now go ahead and open it up.
339968	Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.
339969	What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.
339970	Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this.
339971	We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work.
339972	As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time, if you assume that all magnets had to be hard, then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work.
339973	ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.
339974	But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible, we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
339975	So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
339976	If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material — if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
339977	Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
339978	You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet, and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.
339979	For me, I really love this idea.
339980	(Laughter) If you come to my apartment and see my closet, I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.
339981	KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications — it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
339982	But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference.
339983	ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A., and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
339984	He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company, The Directors Bureau.
339985	As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
339986	And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand — and you know, we shared the same ideas.
339987	And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
339988	These things just get him really excited.
339989	And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
339990	Because the way that he presented the concept — his approach was totally different than ours.
339991	He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
339992	When we were going in the car back to the airport, we were thinking: why was this so powerful?
339993	And as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on TV.
339994	So, for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future.
339995	Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?
339996	Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
339997	Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
339998	KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
339999	So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is.
340000	ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.
340001	So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.
340002	This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.
340003	The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
340004	Now this is important for two reasons.
340005	One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.
340006	In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right, the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
340007	So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.
340008	The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
340009	It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
340010	When you get to the very bottom of the slide — (Laughter) — the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
340011	And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint.
340012	KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal, it's not a magnetic material.
340013	But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
340014	So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
340015	(Laughter) Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
340016	Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force.
340017	ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole, and I have it right here in my pocket.
340018	(Laughter) There're a few different versions of it.
340019	(Laughter) KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
340020	They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.
340021	ZK: As we were talking to the vendor — to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently — he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests — very concealed — and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base.
340022	In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal: so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.
340023	(Laughter)
340024	KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is, you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
340025	(Laughter) So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
340026	Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house — I do it that way.
340027	Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.
340028	Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.
340029	Woman: An olive server.
340030	Man: Some type of extension pole — like what the painters use.
340031	Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving, you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up, and you could swim easier ... Yeah.
340032	(Laughter)
340033	ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration, and so we need a volunteer from the audience.
340034	You sir, come on up.
340035	(Laughter) Come on up.
340036	Tell everybody your name.
340037	Steve Jurvetson: Steve.
340038	ZK: It's Steve.
340039	All right Steve, now, follow me.
340040	We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
340041	Right there.
340042	That's great.
340043	And hold onto this.
340044	Good luck to you.
340045	(Laughter)
340046	KS: No, not yet.
340047	(Laughter)
340048	ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target.
340049	KS: Little bit — that's perfect, just perfect.
340050	Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future.
340051	(Laughter) So here, come on up to the front.
340052	All right, so now if you'll see here — no, no, it's OK.
340053	So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt.
340054	Go ahead.
340055	SJ: It's cold.
340056	KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns — it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
340057	It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
340058	It's so safe you could drink this stuff.
340059	(Laughter) And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water.
340060	(Laughter) All right, well thanks for coming up.
340061	(Laughter)
340062	ZK: Wait, wait, Steven — before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends.
340063	SJ: Excellent, thank you.
340064	KS: Thanks for coming up.
340065	Let's give him a big round of applause.
340066	(Applause)
340067	So what's the significance of this dry liquid?
340068	Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
340069	Now, the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet, that we'd hurt the books or the computers.
340070	It works because it's non-conductive.
340071	So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.
340072	You can circulate it to draw the heat away.
340073	But today it's most widely used in office buildings — in the sprinkler system — as a fire-suppression fluid.
340074	Again, it's perfectly safe for people.
340075	It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
340076	But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game.
340077	So during halftime, it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down, and in a matter of minutes it would dry.
340078	Wouldn't hurt the court.
340079	ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.
340080	While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.
340081	We have a video to show you.
340082	KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back.
340083	Now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
340084	It's technically called, "shape-retaining property." Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
340085	Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place.
340086	Contrast that with a plastic garbage can — and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.
340087	ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle.
340088	Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together — kind of like a little basket — you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
340089	For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
340090	So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
340091	KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.
340092	So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.
340093	Now, to think about the potential for this, think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards, on the back of cereal boxes, board games.
340094	Any place you use ink, you could change the way you interact with it.
340095	ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.
340096	This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
340097	You see the dark line on the side and the top.
340098	As you turn the pages of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on, based on the curvature of the pages.
340099	In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
340100	KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works.
340101	Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.
340102	Who are you?
340103	New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.
340104	OMC: I used to smell like you.
340105	Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.
340106	Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
340107	Don't let milk spoil your morning.
340108	ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys: Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.
340109	KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.
340110	And these dyes change color in response to odors.
340111	So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.
340112	But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect, then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
340113	ZK: Right.
340114	It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself, and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible, beyond just detecting spoiled food.
340115	It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn, how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?
340116	And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
340117	(Laughter) I mean, this is a true story.
340118	They're using policemen as canaries.
340119	(Laughter) But more seriously, they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans, and say if it's safe for the firemen.
340120	In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing, where they're working on medical equipment. So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
340121	By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses, or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results.
340122	This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.
340123	Currently, they're using a method of trial and error, but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.
340124	KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating.
340125	Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world.
340126	Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things — and we're constantly trying to find more.
340127	ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.
340128	I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why.
340129	I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators, and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box, one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand — the sand that doesn't get wet.
340130	He said that he was playing with it with his son.
340131	And you know, his son was mesmerized, because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out and it was bone dry.
340132	A few weeks later, he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair.
340133	And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said, "Look, hydrophobic string." (Laughter) I mean, after hearing that story — that really summed it up for me.
340134	Thank you very much.
340135	KS: Thank you.
340136	(Applause)
340137	I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile: "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him.
340138	Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.
340139	I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
340140	And there it was, a great revolution.
340141	Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime, raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
340142	They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
340143	They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south.
340144	Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.
340145	(Applause)
340146	However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.
340147	For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.
340148	Aware of the devastation and the challenges, I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society, calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation.
340149	Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi — almost 300 in Tripoli.
340150	After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
340151	With an amazing group of women, I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace.
340152	I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections, an environment which was increasingly polarized, an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
340153	I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background, the right to vote and run, and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists, creating the zipper list.
340154	Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.
340155	Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years.
340156	(Applause)
340157	However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections, and of the revolution as a whole, was fading out — for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.
340158	On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.
340159	On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers.
340160	And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law.
340161	Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles — freedom, dignity, social justice — that we first held. Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.
340162	I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
340163	We did not prioritize right. For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
340164	Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation?
340165	No, it didn't.
340166	What is it, then?
340167	Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
340168	Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
340169	Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division.
340170	Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
340171	We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.
340172	We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
340173	We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
340174	These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
340175	For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives.
340176	That's the real zipper.
340177	And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically.
340178	According to a Quranic verse "Salam" — peace — "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" — womb — symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female, from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
340179	And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it, the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
340180	Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things." Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger."
340181	May we all be granted a grace of mercy.
340182	(Applause)
340183	Thank you.
340184	(Applause)
340185	I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion.
340186	It was deep at night.
340187	I do not remember what time it was.
340188	I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking.
340189	Everything in my room was shaking — my heart, my windows, my bed, everything.
340190	I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion.
340191	I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion.
340192	And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
340193	I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night.
340194	Thirty years have passed, and I still feel guilty about that prayer, for the next day, I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father, but did not kill his mother or his sister.
340195	His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son, for she had lost everything.
340196	This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war, and nameless refugees, whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes, dirty face, scared eyes.
340197	This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war, who we do not know their hopes, their dreams, their accomplishments, their families, their beliefs, their values.
340198	This is my story.
340199	I was that girl.
340200	I am another image and vision of another survivor of war.
340201	I am that refugee, and I am that girl.
340202	You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it.
340203	We only talk about one side of it.
340204	But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.
340205	I grew up with the colors of war — the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it.
340206	I grew up with the sounds of war — the staccato sounds of gunfire, the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens.
340207	These are the sounds you would expect, but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night, the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous, unbearable silence. "War," a friend of mine said, "is not about sound at all.
340208	It is actually about silence, the silence of humanity."
340209	I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars.
340210	In my travels and in my work, from Congo to Afghanistan, from Sudan to Rwanda, I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same, but the fears of war are the same.
340211	You know, there is a fear of dying, and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid.
340212	It is very scary to go through that feeling of "I am about to die" or "I could die in this explosion." But there's also the fear of losing loved ones, and I think that's even worse.
340213	It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
340214	But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear — as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me, who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo; she said, "The fear of losing the 'I' in me, the fear of losing the 'I' in me." That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me.
340215	It's like dying from inside-out.
340216	A Palestinian woman once told me, "It is not about the fear of one death," she said, "sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day," as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets.
340217	She said, "But it's not fair, because there is only one life, and there should only be one death."
340218	We have been only seeing one side of war.
340219	We have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels, drawdown timelines, surges and sting operations, when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn, where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going.
340220	We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics, tactics, weapons, dollars and casualties.
340221	This is the language of sterility.
340222	How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic.
340223	This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities.
340224	Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children.
340225	Oh.
340226	Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.
340227	How interesting.
340228	Oh, half a million women in Rwanda get raped in 100 days.
340229	Or, as we speak now, hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated.
340230	How interesting.
340231	These just become numbers that we refer to.
340232	The front of wars is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space, guiding missiles toward unseen targets, while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist.
340233	It is a chess game.
340234	You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership.
340235	Checkmate.
340236	We are missing a completely other side of wars.
340237	We are missing my mother's story, who made sure with every siren, with every raid, with every cut off-of electricity, she played puppet shows for my brothers and I, so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions.
340238	We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher, a piano teacher, in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
340239	That was her fight.
340240	That was her resistance.
340241	We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war, she left out of home, collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after.
340242	We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on, burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
340243	We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars.
340244	Do you know — do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going?
340245	And the ones who are keeping that life are women.
340246	There are two sides of war.
340247	There is a side that fights, and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open.
340248	There is a side that is focused on winning battles, and there is a side that is focused on winning life.
340249	There is a side that leads the front-line discussion, and there is a side that leads the back-line discussion.
340250	There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting, and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs.
340251	There is a side that is led by men, and there is a side that is led by women.
340252	And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace, we must understand war and peace from both sides.
340253	We must have a full picture of what that means.
340254	In order for us to understand what actually peace means, we need to understand, as one Sudanese woman once told me, "Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again." She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan, for 20 years of war, where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees.
340255	Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers, as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers.
340256	So that woman walked for 20 years, so she would not be kidnapped again.
340257	And only when there was some sort of peace, her toenails grew back again.
340258	We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective.
340259	We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table.
340260	I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping, and the group of people who are mostly — though not exclusively — who are keeping life going in the midst of war, are not included in the negotiating table.
340261	And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion, but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion.
340262	The doctors who are not fighting, the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns, they are, too, excluded from the negotiating tables.
340263	There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace, building of democracy, sustainable economies, any kind of stabilities, if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table.
340264	Not one, but 50 percent.
340265	There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls.
340266	Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the U.N. budget and equals 2,928 years of the U.N. budget allocated for women?
340267	If we just reverse that distribution of funds, perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world.
340268	And last, but not least, we need to invest in peace and women, not only because it is the right thing to do, not only because it is the right thing to do, for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today, but it is for the future.
340269	A Congolese woman, who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them, and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them, how they're doing okay right now.
340270	She got into Women for Women International's program.
340271	She got a support network.
340272	She learned about her rights.
340273	We taught her vocational and business skills.
340274	We helped her get a job.
340275	She was earning 450 dollars.
340276	She was doing okay.
340277	She was sending them to school. Have a new home.
340278	She said, "But what I worry about the most is not any of that. I worry that my children have hate in their hearts, and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother." We need to invest in women, because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future.
340279	That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do.
340280	Are there good news?
340281	Of course, there are good news.
340282	There are lots of good news.
340283	To start with, these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day, and if they can, who are we not to dance?
340284	That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars, and I started this from zero, nothing, nada, [unclear].
340285	(Laughter)
340286	They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances, not because of it.
340287	Think of how the world can be a much better place if, for a change, we have a better equality, we have equality, we have a representation and we understand war, both from the front-line and the back-line discussion.
340288	Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet, says, "Out beyond the worlds of right-doings and wrong-doings, there is a field.
340289	I will meet you there.
340290	When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense." I humbly add — humbly add — that out beyond the worlds of war and peace, there is a field, and there are many women and men [who] are meeting there.
340291	Let us make this field a much bigger place.
340292	Let us all meet in that field.
340293	Thank you.
340294	(Applause)
340295	On November 5th, 1990, a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
340296	Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder, but while serving time on lesser charges, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
340297	Thankfully, those plans were foiled by an FBI informant.
340298	Sadly, the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not.
340299	Nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot.
340300	El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
340301	I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer, and a loving American mother and grade school teacher, who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me.
340302	It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change.
340303	My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslims, get to see.
340304	It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another, it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part, we all want the same things out of life.
340305	However, in every religion, in every population, you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do.
340306	A few months prior to his arrest, he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends, he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice.
340307	He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
340308	We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range, which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the FBI.
340309	When it was my turn to shoot, my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off.
340310	That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flames.
340311	My uncle turned to the other men, and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh." Like father, like son.
340312	They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
340313	They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of.
340314	Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others.
340315	These were the men I looked up to.
340316	These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.
340317	By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that instability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends.
340318	Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
340319	Being the perpetual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bullies.
340320	I kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted, but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition.
340321	So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games.
340322	For those reasons, my social skills were lacking, to say the least, and growing up in a bigoted household, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
340323	I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a person's race or religion.
340324	So what opened my eyes?
340325	One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections.
340326	Through a college prep program, I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
340327	My particular group's focus was on youth violence, and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life, this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.
340328	The members of our group came from many different walks of life.
340329	One day toward the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish.
340330	Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us.
340331	I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insurmountable.
340332	Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens, an amusement park.
340333	There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character.
340334	Most of my life, I'd been taught that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension, that all gay people were a negative influence.
340335	As chance would have it, I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performers at a show there, and soon found that many were the kindest, least judgmental people I had ever met.
340336	Being bullied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others, and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated.
340337	Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction.
340338	I don't know what it's like to be gay, but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control.
340339	Then there was "The Daily Show." On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person's race, religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
340340	Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me.
340341	One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change, and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live.
340342	She looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said, "I'm tired of hating people." In that instant, I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
340343	Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
340344	I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life.
340345	So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger?
340346	Well, that's simple.
340347	I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that although I had been subjected to this violent, intolerant ideology, that I did not become fanaticized.
340348	Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism, against the bigotry.
340349	I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives.
340350	For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father's actions.
340351	And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father.
340352	I am not my father.
340353	Thank you.
340354	Thank you, everybody.
340355	Thank you all.
340356	Thanks a lot.
340357	(Applause)
340358	I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work. I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.
340359	Most recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet.
340360	My drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit.
340361	I choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.
340362	If you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.
340363	Behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
340364	And studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report.
340365	Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020.
340366	And sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet by century's end.
340367	I have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics may not.
340368	My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change.
340369	On-site, I take thousands of photographs.
340370	Back in the studio, I work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes over 10 feet wide.
340371	I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors. I consider my work drawings but others call them painting.
340372	(Laughter)
340373	But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper.
340374	Drawing is a form of meditation for me.
340375	It quiets my mind.
340376	I don't perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water.
340377	Instead, the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape.
340378	Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting with foam.
340379	On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10 seconds.
340380	(Laughter)
340381	(Applause)
340382	Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size. But I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.
340383	My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had art supplies all over the house.
340384	My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures.
340385	We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.
340386	In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.
340387	My mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.
340388	She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor.
340389	The cancer quickly took over her body and mind, and she passed away six months later.
340390	During the months of her illness, though, her dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final journey.
340391	My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape.
340392	The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling.
340393	The ice fields are alive with movement and sound in a way that I never expected.
340394	I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you that same sense of awe that I experienced. Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident, so, too, is its vulnerability.
340395	From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.
340396	We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland that now face huge challenges.
340397	The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no longer freezing over as they once did.
340398	And without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival.
340399	The melting glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels, which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
340400	One year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
340401	While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century.
340402	Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal.
340403	When I was in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
340404	Now she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form.
340405	Among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the negative.
340406	My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.
340407	I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring our global community to take action for the future.
340408	Thank you.
340409	(Applause)
340410	(Music) This is the human test, a test to see if you are a human.
340411	Please raise your hand if something applies to you.
340412	Are we agreed?
340413	Yes?
340414	Then let's begin.
340415	Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood?
340416	(Laughter) It's okay, it's safe here.
340417	Have you ever made a small, weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing?
340418	Have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text in order to come across as sad or disappointed?
340419	(Laughter) Okay.
340420	Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression?
340421	Okay.
340422	Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way?
340423	Yes.
340424	Yes.
340425	(Laughter) Good.
340426	Mmm.
340427	Yes, it's safe here.
340428	Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at?
340429	Mmm.
340430	Have you ever broken something in real life, and then found yourself looking for an "undo" button in real life?
340431	Have you ever misplaced your TED badge and then immediately started imagining what a three-day Vancouver vacation might look like?
340432	Have you ever marveled at how someone you thought was so ordinary could suddenly become so beautiful?
340433	Have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?
340434	Have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase "I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot"?
340435	Have you ever been tempted to, and then gave in to the temptation, of looking through someone else's phone?
340436	Have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you're a real asshole to yourself?
340437	(Laughter)
340438	Has your phone ever run out of battery in the middle of an argument, and it sort of felt like the phone was breaking up with both of you?
340439	Have you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this, or this is supposed to happen just naturally?
340440	Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run, just happens naturally?
340441	Have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you?
340442	Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future without a person that no longer was in your life?
340443	Congratulations.
340444	You have now completed the test.
340445	You are all human.
340446	(Applause)
340447	Every presentation needs this slide in it.
340448	(Laughter) It's beautiful, isn't it?
340449	Do you see?
340450	All the points, all the lines — it's incredible.
340451	It is the network; and in my case, the network has been important in media, because I get to connect to people.
340452	Isn't it amazing?
340453	Through that, I connect to people.
340454	And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted.
340455	For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
340456	(Laughter) I put together projects like Earth Sandwich, where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
340457	And people started laying bread in tribute, and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain.
340458	It's pretty incredible — the video's online.
340459	Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example.
340460	In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult.
340461	(Laughter) This is the same person — top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer]. Poignant.
340462	This was a Mother's Day gift.
340463	(Laughter) Particularly creepy. (Applause) (Laughter) My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find, is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap, and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.
340464	And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio. Somebody said, "You have to listen to this." And this is what came to me.
340465	Recording: Hi, my name is Ray, and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair.
340466	Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort, and I didn't really know what to tell her, because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.
340467	So I was led to write this song just for her, just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
340468	And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.
340469	Here's how the song goes.
340470	♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340471	♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340472	♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫
340473	♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫
340474	♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340475	Now you might not be able to sing that out loud, but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.
340476	And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.
340477	All right.
340478	Stay strong.
340479	Peace.
340480	Ze Frank: So — yeah.
340481	No, no, no, shush.
340482	We've got to go quickly.
340483	So I was so moved by this — this is incredible.
340484	This was connecting, right.
340485	This was, at a distance, realizing that someone was feeling something, wanting to affect them in a particular way, using media to do it, putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact.
340486	This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
340487	So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.
340488	And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.
340489	We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
340490	It's actually in the key of B flat.
340491	And have to do something with it." Hundreds of remixes came back — lots of different attempts.
340492	One stood out in particular.
340493	It was done by a guy named Goose.
340494	Remix: ♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340495	♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340496	♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫
340497	♫ You gonna have to send me home ♫
340498	♫ Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫
340499	♫ I'm about to whip some ♫ —
340500	ZF: Great, so it was incredible. That song — (Applause) Thank you.
340501	So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City.
340502	In the end, it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services.
340503	And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album." And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.
340504	And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him, if you can figure out who this person is," because all I had was his name — Ray — and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset.
340505	In two weeks, they found him. I received and email and it said, "Hi, I'm Ray.
340506	I heard you were looking for me." (Laughter) And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.
340507	It's been an interesting two weeks." And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray, and he's a preacher — (Laughter) among other things.
340508	So but anyways, here's the thing — is it reminds me of this, which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
340509	And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
340510	I look at this photo, and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button, but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street. (Laughter) And it makes me think of this.
340511	But the truth is life is being lived there. When they smile — right, you've seen people stop — all of a sudden, life is being lived there, somewhere up in that weird, dense network.
340512	And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
340513	It's the fundamental force that we're all after.
340514	We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier, but ultimately, what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person.
340515	And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.
340516	It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces, and we have to get better at figuring that out.
340517	I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network, a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people.
340518	This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade.
340519	(Laughter)
340520	So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection.
340521	Sometimes they're very, very simple things.
340522	A Childhood Walk, which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless — like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house, and take it inside of Google Streetview. And I promise you, if you take that walk inside Google Streetview, you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face.
340523	And I collected those moments — the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories, specifically. "Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,' and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot." "Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom, I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola." "They used some of the morbidly artist footage, a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.
340524	I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
340525	He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
340526	It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
340527	He died long after he left the pillow at my house, but we never got around to returning it."
340528	Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract.
340529	This is Pain Pack.
340530	Right after September 11th, last year, I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it, the way that we excise it from our bodies. So what I did is I opened up a hotline — a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain, not necessarily related to that event.
340531	And people called in and left messages like this.
340532	Recording: Okay, here's something.
340533	I'm not alone, and I am loved.
340534	I'm really fortunate.
340535	But sometimes I feel really lonely.
340536	And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry. Like even people in convenience stores saying, "Have a nice day," when they're accidentally looking me in the eye.
340537	ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails, and with their permission, converted them to MP3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails.
340538	And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material.
340539	(Music) We don't have time to play much of it.
340540	You can look at it online.
340541	From 52 to 48 with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle, where McCain and Obama both, in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation, and I was like, "What the hell does that look like?" So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try. Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation." And so some really nice things came together. "I voted blue.
340542	I voted red.
340543	Together, for our future." These are very, very cute little things right.
340544	Some came from the winning party. "Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always." Some came from the party who had just lost. "From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you, but I doubt it." But the truth was that as this start becoming popular, a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing, which I could also see.
340545	And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail, death threats even.
340546	And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages, and he was dressed as Batman.
340547	And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity." Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me; which actually made me feel a little better — like, "Phew, it's not him."
340548	So what I did — unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me, and it started to eat away at my psyche. And I was protecting the project from it, I realized.
340549	I was protecting it — I didn't want this special, little group of photographs to get sullied in some way.
340550	So what I did, I took all those emails, and I put them together into something called Angrigami, which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff.
340551	And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami.
340552	(Laughter) But this was the emotional moment.
340553	One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.
340554	It's amazing.
340555	The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know, where the idea was, I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects.
340556	So one of them was fairly straightforward. A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her, his daughter.
340557	And I said, "Oh yeah, I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep." And this was "Scared."
340558	(Video) ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫
340559	♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫
340560	♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫
340561	♫ And somehow I get over it ♫
340562	♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫
340563	♫ I keep on trying despite ♫
340564	♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫
340565	♫ I keep on trying despite ♫
340566	♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫
340567	Okay, so I wrote that song, right.
340568	Thank you.
340569	So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point, and she actually was singing that song to herself.
340570	So I was like, "Awesome.
340571	This is great."
340572	And then I got this email.
340573	And there's a little bit of a back story to this.
340574	And I don't have much time.
340575	But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You, where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person.
340576	So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.
340577	And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.
340578	And I shut that part down.
340579	And I chose two people to be, and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook.
340580	One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't.
340581	And the person who didn't, it turned out, had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
340582	So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?" I was like, "I don't know.
340583	Didn't know I had one."
340584	But anyway, this same person, Laura, ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.
340585	And I felt badly for not having done a good job.
340586	And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job, and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety." So she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.
340587	So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?" And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.
340588	And so what I decided to do.
340589	I said, "Okay, I'll think about it." And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.
340590	(Audio) ♫ Hey ♫
340591	♫ You're okay ♫
340592	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340593	So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities, just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on, so I could just get their voices back.
340594	And this is the kind of thing that I got back.
340595	Recording: ♫ Hey ♫
340596	♫ You're okay ♫
340597	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340598	ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.
340599	But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them, all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.
340600	And when you put them together, something magical happens, something absolutely incredible happens, and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.
340601	And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background, and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.
340602	And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.
340603	I just want to say thanks for even considering it." And then a few days later I sent her this.
340604	(Audio) ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫
340605	♫ And things that looked so good yesterday ♫
340606	♫ are now shades of gray ♫
340607	♫ And it seems like the world is spinning ♫
340608	♫ while I'm standing still ♫
340609	♫ Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell ♫
340610	♫ And then you say ♫
340611	♫ Hey ♫
340612	♫ You're okay ♫
340613	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340614	♫ Just breathe ♫
340615	♫ And now the words sing ♫
340616	♫ Hey ♫
340617	♫ You're okay ♫
340618	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340619	♫ Just breathe ♫
340620	♫ Now everybody sings ♫
340621	♫ Hey ♫
340622	♫ You're okay ♫
340623	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340624	♫ Just breathe ♫
340625	♫ Hey ♫
340626	♫ You're okay ♫
340627	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340628	♫ Just breathe ♫
340629	♫ Hey ♫
340630	♫ You're okay ♫
340631	♫ You'll be fine ♫
340632	♫ Just breathe ♫
340633	Thank you.
340634	(Applause)
340635	You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no, because I felt like I wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
340636	It's such a large conference.
340637	But he explained to me that he was in a bind, and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for.
340638	So I said fine, Ted — I mean Chris.
340639	I'll come on two conditions.
340640	One: I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
340641	And two: I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
340642	And luckily he agreed.
340643	And the theme, in two years, is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies." (Video) (Music)
340644	[WORD.]
340645	(Applause)
340646	I invented the Placebo Camera.
340647	(Laughter)
340648	It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper, and you still feel like you were there.
340649	(Laughter)
340650	(Laughter) "Dear Sir, good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes to you and family.
340651	(Breathes in) I know this letter will come to you surprisingly, but let it not be a surprise to you, for nature has a way of arriving unannounced, and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find, but their echoes sound ouder.
340652	So I decided to contact you myself, for you to assure me of safety and honesty, if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
340653	I am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone but was killed during the civil war.
340654	(Laughter)
340655	Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.
340656	(Laughter)
340657	Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.
340658	(Laughter)
340659	This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war.
340660	When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him, my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
340661	Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about it because my father always confide in me.
340662	(Sighs) I made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker, who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown, although he did not know the real contents of the box.
340663	(Laughter)
340664	The fund was deposited as a family reasure, in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal, where I was only given temporary asylum.
340665	I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
340666	The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me, are the following: one, be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust; two, provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted; three, receive the funds into your account in trust; take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
340667	Sincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura."
340668	(Laughter)
340669	(Applause)
340670	This is really embarrassing.
340671	I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
340672	I only prepared 15.
340673	(Laughter)
340674	So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.
340675	(Laughter)
340676	I'm really sorry.
340677	(Laughter)
340678	(Applause)
340679	What's your name?
340680	(Laughter)
340681	Mark Surfas.
340682	It's pretty cool, huh?
340683	Pursuing happiness.
340684	(Laughter)
340685	Are you a virgin?
340686	Virgin?
340687	I mean — no, I mean like in the TED sense?
340688	(Laughter)
340689	Are you?
340690	Oh, yeah?
340691	So what are you, like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there?
340692	Huh?
340693	Oh?
340694	You don't know what I'm talking about?
340695	(Laughter)
340696	Ah, Mark —
340697	(Laughter)
340698	Surfas.
340699	(Laughter)
340700	1,860 — am I good?
340701	And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
340702	That's nothing to be ashamed of.
340703	(Applause)
340704	Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
340705	Really cool, we were getting wasted.
340706	(Laughter) And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime, they can actually predict what you are going to say —
340707	(Laughter) next.
340708	And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."
340709	(Laughter)
340710	But they said, "No, but don't show anyone." But they slipped up.
340711	And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?" and my name, and it would tell me.
340712	And I have to tell you, this is an unadulterated piece of software, this is a real Internet browser and this is the actual Google site, and we're going to test it out live today.
340713	What was I going to say next?
340714	And "Ze Frank" — that's me.
340715	Am I feeling lucky?
340716	(Laughter)
340717	(Shouting) Am I feeling lucky?
340718	Audience: Yes! Yeah!
340719	(Sighs) (Laughter)
340720	Ze Frank: Oh! Amazing.
340721	(Laughter)
340722	In March of 2001 —
340723	(Laughter)
340724	I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love." On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends, as part of an invitation to my — an invitation to my th — th — 26th birthday party.
340725	(Laughter)
340726	(Clears throat) By Monday, over a million people were coming to this site a day.
340727	(Sighs)
340728	(Laughter) Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said, due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge, I owed them 30,000 dollars.
340729	(Laughter)
340730	Needless to say, I was able to leave my job. [WAS LAID OFF]
340731	(Laughter)
340732	And, finally, you know, become freelance.
340733	(Laughter)
340734	[UNEMPLOYED] But some people refer to me more as, like, an Internet guru or —
340735	[JACKASS]
340736	swami.
340737	(Laughter)
340738	I knew I had something.
340739	I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here, because it's a little too deep for all of you, but —
340740	(Laughter)
340741	It's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's —
340742	[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]
340743	It's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
340744	Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.
340745	(Laughter)
340746	I'm obsessed with email.
340747	I get a lot of it.
340748	Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
340749	It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
340750	You can kind of peer into other people's lives. And I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user.
340751	For example, somebody wrote, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder, you should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"
340752	(Video) (Music) And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out, but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked."
340753	(Laughter)
340754	And that was embarrassing.
340755	But you know, it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure." [rocking out naked]
340756	(Laughter)
340757	I hear a lot of you whispering.
340758	(Laughter)
340759	And I know what you're saying, "Holy crap!
340760	How is his presentation so smooth?"
340761	(Laughter)
340762	And I have to say that it's not all me this year.
340763	I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past, I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED.
340764	I don't know.
340765	And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED conference simulator.
340766	(Laughter)
340767	Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches, and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
340768	And I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
340769	(Pre-recorded applause)
340770	I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.
340771	Not just the good stuff, though.
340772	You can do heckler mode.
340773	Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!
340774	ZF: You get off the stage.
340775	(Laughter)
340776	Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.
340777	(Laughter)
340778	(Huge crowd applauding)
340779	In case you run over time.
340780	(Heroic music) Just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really —
340781	(Laughter)
340782	I'd like to thank all of you for being here.
340783	(Laughter)
340784	And frog mode.
340785	(Singing) (Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp —"
340786	(Laughter)
340787	[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]
340788	(Sighs)
340789	It's true.
340790	Some people say to me, "Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff, and you're not making any money."
340791	(Laughter)
340792	Why? And I say, "Mom, Dad —
340793	(Laughter)
340794	I'm trying." I don't know if you're all aware of this, but the video game market, kids are playing these video games, but, supposedly, there's tons of money.
340795	I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things.
340796	So I decided to try my hand.
340797	I came up with a few games.
340798	(Laughter)
340799	This is called "Atheist." I figured it would be popular with the young kids.
340800	OK. Look, I'll move around and say some things.
340801	(Sighs)
340802	(Laughter)
340803	So that didn't go over so well.
340804	(Laughter)
340805	I don't really understand why you're laughing.
340806	(Laughter)
340807	Should have done this before I tried to pitch it. "Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
340808	(Laughter)
340809	But you come back as a duck.
340810	(Laughter)
340811	And this is great because, you know, for a quarter, you can play this for a long time.
340812	(Laughter)
340813	And Chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to TED, something that we haven't shown anyone.
340814	So, I made this for TED.
340815	It's "Christian." It's the third in the series.
340816	I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.
340817	(Sighs) (Laughter)
340818	Do you have a preference?
340819	(Laughter) Good choice.
340820	(Laughter)
340821	So you can wait for the Second Coming,
340822	which is a random number between one and 500 million.
340823	(Laughter)
340824	So really, what are we talking about here?
340825	Oh, tech joy.
340826	(Laughter)
340827	Tech joy, to me, means something, because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
340828	And in fact, making things using technology — and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice — I won't — hold on.
340829	Making things, you know — making things actually does give me a lot of joy.
340830	It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life, and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project — where you know you still have something to do, but it's not finished, and you're not starting something — that really fills my entire life.
340831	And so, what I've done is, I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists.
340832	We're in a culture of guru-ship.
340833	It's so hard to use some software because, you know, it's unapproachable, people feel like they have to read the manual.
340834	So I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully — ("The End" by The Doors)
340835	(Laughter) It's, like — seriously, though —
340836	(Laughter)
340837	I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves.
340838	(Laughter)
340839	Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack," which, I think, really resonated with the working population.
340840	(Laughter)
340841	Over 500 entries in three weeks. Toilet paper fashion.
340842	(Laughter)
340843	Again, people from all over the country. The watch is particularly incredible.
340844	(Laughter)
340845	Online drawing tools — you've probably seen a lot of them.
340846	I think they're wonderful.
340847	It's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff.
340848	But I'm interested in the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.
340849	And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing, and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure, awful little thing that they created.
340850	And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it, or they draw penises and things like that.
340851	(Laughter)
340852	So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
340853	In other words, it's a helping tool.
340854	You can draw your simple stick figure, and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post-war German etching.
340855	(Laughter)
340856	In fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse.
340857	So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling. So the idea is that you can really, you know, partake in this process, but watch something really crappy look beautiful.
340858	And here are some of my favorites.
340859	This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me.
340860	Very cool.
340861	(Laughter)
340862	Darling.
340863	Beautiful stuff.
340864	I mean this is incredible.
340865	An 11-year-old girl drew this and submitted it.
340866	It's just gorgeous.
340867	(Laughter)
340868	I'm dead serious here.
340869	This is not a joke.
340870	(Laughter)
340871	But, I think it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
340872	So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space, which is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing.
340873	These are haikus.
340874	None of the haikus were written by the same person. In fact, each line is contributed by a different person at a different time.
340875	I think that the "now tied up, tied down, mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up." It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you, if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is, says, "Let's talk" — That, like, chills you to the very core. (Laughter)
340876	But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
340877	They actually get to know each other, and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking.
340878	And very, very quickly — I love puppets.
340879	Here's a puppet.
340880	It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s, that started doing more elaborate things.
340881	I became interested in puppets, and I just want to show one last thing to you.
340882	Oh, this is how you make puppets.
340883	(Applause)
340884	Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.
340885	(Applause)
340886	I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years.
340887	All right.
340888	We all have come from a long way, here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa, which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
340889	And I say that not because I am African, but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors, upright walking traces, even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
340890	So we all are Africans, and welcome home.
340891	All right.
340892	I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define man's place in nature and explore what makes us human. And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered, to tell you a story of all of us.
340893	Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
340894	She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
340895	You don't need to remember that.
340896	That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
340897	It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
340898	And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
340899	We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
340900	And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
340901	After I was invited by TED, I did some digging, because that's what we do, to know about my host.
340902	You don't just jump into an invitation.
340903	And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
340904	First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
340905	And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old — beads.
340906	And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
340907	And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
340908	I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry.
340909	However, DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end, telling us nothing about what happened in the middle.
340910	So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence, the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development.
340911	Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about — (Laughter) — it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times, and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today.
340912	But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
340913	It's a systematic and scientific approach, which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
340914	Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika, where Selam was found, in '99 — and it's about 500 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
340915	It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500, but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
340916	With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
340917	I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
340918	When you get there, this is what you see, and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
340919	And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
340920	(Laughter) And you find nothing for years and years.
340921	When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites, it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
340922	But what you find are not the human remains, such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
340923	You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
340924	But you could ask, how could these large mammals live in this desert environment?
340925	Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
340926	A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
340927	Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
340928	And our ancestors lived in that game park, but were just the minorities.
340929	They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
340930	To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity, I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here, and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
340931	They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for." I would say, "No, that's an elephant." Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.
340932	So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.
340933	You either don't know what you're looking for, or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
340934	(Laughter) And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions, and the people were scared and went somewhere else.
340935	Let's go somewhere else." Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
340936	It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam, and you see the face here covered by sandstone.
340937	And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block, because she was buried by a river.
340938	What you have here seems to be nothing, but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human.
340939	This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology, an amazing piece of our long, long history.
340940	There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures, that's why I am not in.
340941	How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand, but you are in the middle of nowhere?
340942	The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement, of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility, of making sure everything is safe.
340943	Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning, preparation and description, which was very long, as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide.
340944	It took five years.
340945	In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long.
340946	And here is full scale — it's a tiny bone.
340947	And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism, who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
340948	And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister.
340949	So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
340950	(Laughter) Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.
340951	We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs, the foot, and some features clearly showed that she walked upright, and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
340952	But in addition, if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here, you see that you have vertical forehead. And you see that in humans, because of the development of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
340953	You don't see that in chimpanzees, and you don't see this very projecting canine. So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course, you do detailed analysis, and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species, known as Australopithecus afarensis.
340954	The next exciting question is, girl or boy? And how old was she when she died?
340955	You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth.
340956	How?
340957	You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism, which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females.
340958	But to do that, you need the permanent dentition, which you don't see here, because what you have here are the baby teeth.
340959	But using the CT scanning technology, which is normally used for medical purposes, you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still-growing adult teeth here.
340960	So when you measure those teeth, it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth.
340961	And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
340962	So, this girl died when she was about three, 3.3 million years ago.
340963	So, with all that information, the big question is — what do we actually — what does she tell us?
340964	To answer this question, we can phrase another question. What do we actually know about our ancestors?
340965	We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved, how they walked around, and how they lived and grew up.
340966	And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included: first, this skeleton documents, for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
340967	And second, she tells us that she walked upright, but had some adaptation for tree climbing.
340968	And more interesting, however, is the brain in this child was still growing.
340969	At age three, if you have a still-growing brain, it's a human behavior.
340970	In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
340971	That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth — faster than us, anyway.
340972	But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
340973	That's why we need care from our parents.
340974	But that care means also you learn.
340975	You spend more time with your parents.
340976	And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood, which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents.
340977	So, the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood, which requires an incredible social organization, a very complex social organization, emerged over three million years ago.
340978	So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history, Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human.
340979	But not everything was human, and I will give you a very exciting example.
340980	This is called the hyoid bone.
340981	It's a bone which is right here.
340982	It supports your tongue from behind.
340983	It's, in a way, your voice box.
340984	It determines the type of voice you produce.
340985	It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton.
340986	When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
340987	So if you were there 3.3 million years ago, to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother, she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
340988	Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.
340989	What does that tell us?" You know, that is very exciting for us, because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively, and that evolution is in the making.
340990	To summarize the significance of this fossil, we can say the following.
340991	Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
340992	They don't preserve well, as you know.
340993	So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors, on how they looked like, how they behaved, was kind of biased toward adults.
340994	Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies, the children, and he goes back and reports.
340995	Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?
340996	That's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children, so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
340997	So, I think the most important question at the end is, what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general?
340998	Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human, you know, the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years — and there are more than 10 — they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications that we, Homo sapiens, have today.
340999	But if this species, ancient species, would travel in time and see us today, they would very much be very proud of their legacy, because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe.
341000	And they were probably not aware of this future legacy, but they did great.
341001	Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
341002	So the question is, are we up to the challenge?
341003	And can we really do better than these primitive, small-brained ancestors?
341004	Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
341005	Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people to talk about this.
341006	Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.
341007	One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa, carrying guns, that depends on other people forever, or to promote an Africa which is confident, peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time.
341008	I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
341009	And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
341010	That's because we Africans concentrate — I am from Ethiopia, by the way — we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere, or from outside.
341011	I think it's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves.
341012	That's what I call positive African attitude.
341013	So finally, I would like to say, so let's help Africa walk upright and forward, then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
341014	Thank you.
341015	(Applause)
341016	So, I started my first job as a computer programmer in my very first year of college — basically, as a teenager.
341017	Soon after I started working, writing software in a company, a manager who worked at the company came down to where I was, and he whispered to me, "Can he tell if I'm lying?" There was nobody else in the room.
341018	Can who tell if you're lying? من الذي سيُخبرإذا كنتَ تكذب؟
341019	And why are we whispering?"
341020	The manager pointed at the computer in the room. "Can he tell if I'm lying?" Well, that manager was having an affair with the receptionist.
341021	(Laughter)
341022	And I was still a teenager.
341023	So I whisper-shouted back to him, "Yes, the computer can tell if you're lying."
341024	(Laughter)
341025	Well, I laughed, but actually, the laugh's on me.
341026	Nowadays, there are computational systems that can suss out emotional states and even lying from processing human faces.
341027	Advertisers and even governments are very interested.
341028	I had become a computer programmer because I was one of those kids crazy about math and science.
341029	But somewhere along the line I'd learned about nuclear weapons, and I'd gotten really concerned with the ethics of science.
341030	I was troubled.
341031	However, because of family circumstances, I also needed to start working as soon as possible.
341032	So I thought to myself, hey, let me pick a technical field where I can get a job easily and where I don't have to deal with any troublesome questions of ethics.
341033	So I picked computers.
341034	(Laughter)
341035	Well, ha, ha, ha!
341036	All the laughs are on me.
341037	Nowadays, computer scientists are building platforms that control what a billion people see every day.
341038	They're developing cars that could decide who to run over.
341039	They're even building machines, weapons, that might kill human beings in war.
341040	It's ethics all the way down.
341041	Machine intelligence is here.
341042	We're now using computation to make all sort of decisions, but also new kinds of decisions.
341043	We're asking questions to computation that have no single right answers, that are subjective and open-ended and value-laden.
341044	We're asking questions like, "Who should the company hire?" "Which update from which friend should you be shown?" "Which convict is more likely to reoffend?" "Which news item or movie should be recommended to people?"
341045	Look, yes, we've been using computers for a while, but this is different.
341046	This is a historical twist, because we cannot anchor computation for such subjective decisions the way we can anchor computation for flying airplanes, building bridges, going to the moon. Are airplanes safer?
341047	Did the bridge sway and fall?
341048	There, we have agreed-upon, fairly clear benchmarks, and we have laws of nature to guide us.
341049	We have no such anchors and benchmarks for decisions in messy human affairs.
341050	To make things more complicated, our software is getting more powerful, but it's also getting less transparent and more complex.
341051	Recently, in the past decade, complex algorithms have made great strides.
341052	They can recognize human faces.
341053	They can decipher handwriting.
341054	They can detect credit card fraud and block spam and they can translate between languages.
341055	They can detect tumors in medical imaging.
341056	They can beat humans in chess and Go.
341057	Much of this progress comes from a method called "machine learning." Machine learning is different than traditional programming, where you give the computer detailed, exact, painstaking instructions.
341058	It's more like you take the system and you feed it lots of data, including unstructured data, like the kind we generate in our digital lives.
341059	And the system learns by churning through this data.
341060	And also, crucially, these systems don't operate under a single-answer logic.
341061	They don't produce a simple answer; it's more probabilistic: "This one is probably more like what you're looking for."
341062	Now, the upside is: this method is really powerful.
341063	The head of Google's AI systems called it, "the unreasonable effectiveness of data." The downside is, we don't really understand what the system learned.
341064	In fact, that's its power.
341065	This is less like giving instructions to a computer; it's more like training a puppy-machine-creature we don't really understand or control.
341066	So this is our problem.
341067	It's a problem when this artificial intelligence system gets things wrong.
341068	It's also a problem when it gets things right, because we don't even know which is which when it's a subjective problem.
341069	We don't know what this thing is thinking.
341070	So, consider a hiring algorithm — a system used to hire people, using machine-learning systems.
341071	Such a system would have been trained on previous employees' data and instructed to find and hire people like the existing high performers in the company.
341072	Sounds good.
341073	I once attended a conference that brought together human resources managers and executives, high-level people, using such systems in hiring.
341074	They were super excited.
341075	They thought that this would make hiring more objective, less biased, and give women and minorities a better shot against biased human managers.
341076	And look — human hiring is biased.
341077	I know.
341078	I mean, in one of my early jobs as a programmer, my immediate manager would sometimes come down to where I was really early in the morning or really late in the afternoon, and she'd say, "Zeynep, let's go to lunch!" I'd be puzzled by the weird timing.
341079	It's 4pm.
341080	Lunch?
341081	I was broke, so free lunch.
341082	I always went.
341083	I later realized what was happening.
341084	My immediate managers had not confessed to their higher-ups that the programmer they hired for a serious job was a teen girl who wore jeans and sneakers to work.
341085	I was doing a good job, I just looked wrong and was the wrong age and gender.
341086	So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way certainly sounds good to me.
341087	But with these systems, it is more complicated, and here's why: Currently, computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs, even if you have not disclosed those things.
341088	They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings.
341089	They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.
341090	Remember — for things you haven't even disclosed.
341091	This is inference.
341092	I have a friend who developed such computational systems to predict the likelihood of clinical or postpartum depression from social media data.
341093	The results are impressive.
341094	Her system can predict the likelihood of depression months before the onset of any symptoms — months before.
341095	No symptoms, there's prediction.
341096	She hopes it will be used for early intervention.
341097	Great!
341098	But now put this in the context of hiring.
341099	So at this human resources managers conference, I approached a high-level manager in a very large company, and I said to her, "Look, what if, unbeknownst to you, your system is weeding out people with high future likelihood of depression?
341100	They're not depressed now, just maybe in the future, more likely.
341101	What if it's weeding out women more likely to be pregnant in the next year or two but aren't pregnant now?
341102	What if it's hiring aggressive people because that's your workplace culture?" You can't tell this by looking at gender breakdowns.
341103	Those may be balanced.
341104	And since this is machine learning, not traditional coding, there is no variable there labeled "higher risk of depression," "higher risk of pregnancy," "aggressive guy scale." Not only do you not know what your system is selecting on, you don't even know where to begin to look.
341105	It's a black box.
341106	It has predictive power, but you don't understand it.
341107	What safeguards, I asked, "do you have to make sure that your black box isn't doing something shady?" She looked at me as if I had just stepped on 10 puppy tails.
341108	(Laughter)
341109	She stared at me and she said, "I don't want to hear another word about this." And she turned around and walked away.
341110	Mind you — she wasn't rude.
341111	It was clearly: what I don't know isn't my problem, go away, death stare.
341112	(Laughter)
341113	Look, such a system may even be less biased than human managers in some ways.
341114	And it could make monetary sense.
341115	But it could also lead to a steady but stealthy shutting out of the job market of people with higher risk of depression.
341116	Is this the kind of society we want to build, without even knowing we've done this, because we turned decision-making to machines we don't totally understand?
341117	Another problem is this: these systems are often trained on data generated by our actions, human imprints.
341118	Well, they could just be reflecting our biases, and these systems could be picking up on our biases and amplifying them and showing them back to us, while we're telling ourselves, "We're just doing objective, neutral computation."
341119	Researchers found that on Google, women are less likely than men to be shown job ads for high-paying jobs.
341120	And searching for African-American names is more likely to bring up ads suggesting criminal history, even when there is none.
341121	Such hidden biases and black-box algorithms that researchers uncover sometimes but sometimes we don't know, can have life-altering consequences.
341122	In Wisconsin, a defendant was sentenced to six years in prison for evading the police.
341123	You may not know this, but algorithms are increasingly used in parole and sentencing decisions.
341124	He wanted to know: How is this score calculated?
341125	It's a commercial black box.
341126	The company refused to have its algorithm be challenged in open court.
341127	But ProPublica, an investigative nonprofit, audited that very algorithm with what public data they could find, and found that its outcomes were biased and its predictive power was dismal, barely better than chance, and it was wrongly labeling black defendants as future criminals at twice the rate of white defendants.
341128	So, consider this case: This woman was late picking up her godsister from a school in Broward County, Florida, running down the street with a friend of hers.
341129	They spotted an unlocked kid's bike and a scooter on a porch and foolishly jumped on it.
341130	As they were speeding off, a woman came out and said, "Hey!
341131	That's my kid's bike!" They dropped it, they walked away, but they were arrested.
341132	She was wrong, she was foolish, but she was also just 18.
341133	She had a couple of juvenile misdemeanors.
341134	Meanwhile, that man had been arrested for shoplifting in Home Depot — 85 dollars' worth of stuff, a similar petty crime.
341135	But he had two prior armed robbery convictions.
341136	But the algorithm scored her as high risk, and not him.
341137	Two years later, ProPublica found that she had not reoffended.
341138	It was just hard to get a job for her with her record.
341139	He, on the other hand, did reoffend and is now serving an eight-year prison term for a later crime.
341140	Clearly, we need to audit our black boxes and not have them have this kind of unchecked power.
341141	(Applause)
341142	Audits are great and important, but they don't solve all our problems.
341143	Take Facebook's powerful news feed algorithm — you know, the one that ranks everything and decides what to show you from all the friends and pages you follow.
341144	Should you be shown another baby picture?
341145	(Laughter)
341146	A sullen note from an acquaintance?
341147	An important but difficult news item?
341148	There's no right answer.
341149	Facebook optimizes for engagement on the site: likes, shares, comments.
341150	In August of 2014, protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, after the killing of an African-American teenager by a white police officer, under murky circumstances.
341151	The news of the protests was all over my algorithmically unfiltered Twitter feed, but nowhere on my Facebook.
341152	Was it my Facebook friends?
341153	I disabled Facebook's algorithm, which is hard because Facebook keeps wanting to make you come under the algorithm's control, and saw that my friends were talking about it.
341154	It's just that the algorithm wasn't showing it to me.
341155	I researched this and found this was a widespread problem.
341156	The story of Ferguson wasn't algorithm-friendly.
341157	It's not "likable." Who's going to click on "like?" It's not even easy to comment on.
341158	Without likes and comments, the algorithm was likely showing it to even fewer people, so we didn't get to see this.
341159	Instead, that week, Facebook's algorithm highlighted this, which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.
341160	Worthy cause; dump ice water, donate to charity, fine.
341161	But it was super algorithm-friendly.
341162	The machine made this decision for us.
341163	A very important but difficult conversation might have been smothered, had Facebook been the only channel.
341164	Now, finally, these systems can also be wrong in ways that don't resemble human systems.
341165	Do you guys remember Watson, IBM's machine-intelligence system that wiped the floor with human contestants on Jeopardy?
341166	It was a great player.
341167	But then, for Final Jeopardy, Watson was asked this question: "Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero, its second-largest for a World War II battle."
341168	(Hums Final Jeopardy music)
341169	Chicago.
341170	The two humans got it right.
341171	Watson, on the other hand, answered "Toronto" — for a US city category!
341172	The impressive system also made an error that a human would never make, a second-grader wouldn't make.
341173	Our machine intelligence can fail in ways that don't fit error patterns of humans, in ways we won't expect and be prepared for.
341174	It'd be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for, but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some subroutine.
341175	(Laughter)
341176	In May of 2010, a flash crash on Wall Street fueled by a feedback loop in Wall Street's "sell" algorithm wiped a trillion dollars of value in 36 minutes.
341177	I don't even want to think what "error" means in the context of lethal autonomous weapons.
341178	So yes, humans have always made biases.
341179	Decision makers and gatekeepers, in courts, in news, in war ... they make mistakes; but that's exactly my point.
341180	We cannot escape these difficult questions.
341181	We cannot outsource our responsibilities to machines.
341182	(Applause)
341183	Artificial intelligence does not give us a "Get out of ethics free" card.
341184	Data scientist Fred Benenson calls this math-washing.
341185	We need the opposite.
341186	We need to cultivate algorithm suspicion, scrutiny and investigation.
341187	We need to make sure we have algorithmic accountability, auditing and meaningful transparency.
341188	We need to accept that bringing math and computation to messy, value-laden human affairs does not bring objectivity; rather, the complexity of human affairs invades the algorithms.
341189	Yes, we can and we should use computation to help us make better decisions.
341190	But we have to own up to our moral responsibility to judgment, and use algorithms within that framework, not as a means to abdicate and outsource our responsibilities to one another as human to human.
341191	Machine intelligence is here.
341192	That means we must hold on ever tighter to human values and human ethics.
341193	Thank you.
341194	(Applause)
341195	So recently, we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest, and that's true, but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements, I've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them.
341196	This is not inevitable, but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term.
341197	And the lessons apply in multiple domains.
341198	Now, take Turkey's Gezi Park protests, July 2013, which I went back to study in the field.
341199	Twitter was key to its organizing.
341200	It was everywhere in the park — well, along with a lot of tear gas.
341201	It wasn't all high tech.
341202	But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed 34 Kurdish smugglers near the border region, and Turkish media completely censored this news.
341203	Editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do.
341204	One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore.
341205	He purchased his own plane ticket, and went to the village where this had occurred.
341206	And he was confronted by this scene: a line of coffins coming down a hill, relatives wailing.
341207	He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt, and didn't know what to do, so he took out his phone, like any one of us might, and snapped that picture and tweeted it out.
341208	And voila, that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it.
341209	So when, a year later, Turkey's Gezi protests happened, it started as a protest about a park being razed, but became an anti-authoritarian protest.
341210	It wasn't surprising that media also censored it, but it got a little ridiculous at times.
341211	When things were so intense, when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul, CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins.
341212	Now, I love penguin documentaries, but that wasn't the news of the day.
341213	An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture, and that one too went viral, and since then, people call Turkish media the penguin media. (Laughter)
341214	But this time, people knew what to do.
341215	They just took out their phones and looked for actual news.
341216	Better, they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media.
341217	Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations.
341218	Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies.
341219	And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way.
341220	Remember the Zapatistas, the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked, pipe-smoking, charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?
341221	That was probably the first movement that got global attention thanks to the Internet.
341222	Or consider Seattle '99, when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization, the World Trade Organization, by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize.
341223	And more recently, movement after movement has shaken country after country: the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more; indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece; the Gezi Park protests; Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.
341224	And think of more recent initiatives, like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags. Nowadays, a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign.
341225	A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization.
341226	Amazing.
341227	But think of the moments I just mentioned.
341228	The achievements they were able to have, their outcomes, are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired.
341229	The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end.
341230	And this raises a question: As digital technology makes things easier for movements, why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well?
341231	In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics, are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way?
341232	Now, I believe so.
341233	I believe that the rule of thumb is: Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains.
341234	Now, to be clear, technology does empower in multiple ways.
341235	It's very powerful.
341236	In Turkey, I watched four young college students organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called 140Journos that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country.
341237	In Egypt, I saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals, very large operations, during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in 2011.
341238	And I asked the founder of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies, how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started. "Five minutes," he said.
341239	Five minutes.
341240	And he had no training or background in logistics.
341241	Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011.
341242	It started with a single email from a magazine, Adbusters, to 90,000 subscribers in its list.
341243	About two months after that first email, there were in the United States 600 ongoing occupations and protests.
341244	Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park, a global protest was held in about 82 countries, 950 cities.
341245	It was one of the largest global protests ever organized.
341246	Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system, which they wanted to boycott.
341247	They'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after Rosa Parks was arrested.
341248	But how do you get the word out — tomorrow we're going to start the boycott — when you don't have Facebook, texting, Twitter, none of that?
341249	So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night, secretly.
341250	They then used the 68 African-American organizations that criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand.
341251	And the logistical tasks were daunting, because these were poor people.
341252	They had to get to work, boycott or no, so a massive carpool was organized, again by meeting.
341253	No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.
341254	They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going.
341255	Today, it would be so much easier.
341256	We could create a database, available rides and what rides you need, have the database coordinate, and use texting.
341257	We wouldn't have to meet all that much.
341258	But again, consider this: the Civil Rights Movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers, faced repression and overcame, won major policy concessions, navigated and innovated through risks.
341259	In contrast, three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality, the policies that fueled it are still in place.
341260	Europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests, but the continent didn't shift its direction.
341261	In embracing these technologies, are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained?
341262	To understand this, I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people, from activists to politicians, from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements.
341263	I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing.
341264	They were frustrated, and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for.
341265	This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with.
341266	And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt. Everest with the help of 60 Sherpas, and the Internet is our Sherpa.
341267	What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work.
341268	Because, you see, the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting, tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks, they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together, create consensus and innovate, and maybe even more crucially, keep going together through differences.
341269	So when you see this March on Washington in 1963, when you look at that picture, where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous "I have a dream" speech, 1963, you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech, you also see the painstaking, long-term work that can put on that march.
341270	And if you're in power, you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march, not just the march, but the capacity signaled by that march, seriously.
341271	In contrast, when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks, you see a lot of discontent, but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term.
341272	And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides.
341273	Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges.
341274	They feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next, and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions.
341275	Now, I want to be clear: The magic is not in the mimeograph.
341276	It's in that capacity to work together, think together collectively, which can only be built over time with a lot of work.
341277	To understand all this, I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey, and I ask him, "How do you do it?" They too use digital technology extensively, so that's not it.
341278	So what's the secret?
341279	Well, he told me.
341280	He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea.
341281	I said, what has that got to do with anything?
341282	Well, he said, his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one, and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes, in their wedding parties, circumcision ceremonies, and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes.
341283	With that many meetings every day, with tea offered at every one of them, which he could not refuse, because that would be rude, he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea, because that would be many kilos of sugar, he can't even calculate how many kilos, and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast.
341284	We had met in the afternoon, and he was already way over-caffeinated. But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins.
341285	To be sure, governments have different resources to bring to the table.
341286	It's not the same game, but the differences are instructive.
341287	And like all such stories, this is not a story just of technology.
341288	It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do.
341289	Today's social movements want to operate informally.
341290	They do not want institutional leadership.
341291	They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation.
341292	They have a point.
341293	Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests.
341294	But operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system, which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out, and even more corrupt politics.
341295	And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles, because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial.
341296	Climate change is barreling towards us.
341297	Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies.
341298	Authoritarianism is choking many countries.
341299	We need movements to be more effective.
341300	Now, some people have argued that the problem is today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before, and that is not true.
341301	From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere, I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line.
341302	It's also not true, as Malcolm Gladwell claimed, that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties.
341303	No, they come to these protests, just like before, with their friends, existing networks, and sometimes they do make new friends for life.
341304	I still see the friends that I made in those Zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago, and the bonds between strangers are not worthless.
341305	When I got tear-gassed in Gezi, people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away.
341306	In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters, working really hard to keep each other safe and protected.
341307	And digital awareness-raising is great, because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics.
341308	But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively, develop strong policy proposals, create consensus, figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage, because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough.
341309	And there are many efforts.
341310	In New Zealand, a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio for participatory decision making at scale.
341311	In Turkey, 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism.
341312	In Argentina, an open-source platform called DemocracyOS is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties.
341313	These are all great, and we need more, but the answer won't just be better online decision-making, because to update democracy, we are going to need to innovate at every level, from the organizational to the political to the social.
341314	Because to succeed over the long term, sometimes you do need tea without sugar along with your Twitter.
341315	Thank you.
341316	(Applause)
341317	So when people voice fears of artificial intelligence, very often, they invoke images of humanoid robots run amok. You know?
341318	Terminator? You know, that might be something to consider, but that's a distant threat.
341319	Or, we fret about digital surveillance with metaphors from the past. "1984," George Orwell's "1984," it's hitting the bestseller lists again.
341320	It's a great book, but it's not the correct dystopia for the 21st century.
341321	What we need to fear most is not what artificial intelligence will do to us on its own, but how the people in power will use artificial intelligence to control us and to manipulate us in novel, sometimes hidden, subtle and unexpected ways.
341322	Much of the technology that threatens our freedom and our dignity in the near-term future is being developed by companies in the business of capturing and selling our data and our attention to advertisers and others: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent.
341323	Now, artificial intelligence has started bolstering their business as well. And it may seem like artificial intelligence is just the next thing after online ads.
341324	It's not.
341325	It's a jump in category. It's a whole different world, and it has great potential.
341326	It could accelerate our understanding of many areas of study and research.
341327	But to paraphrase a famous Hollywood philosopher, "With prodigious potential comes prodigious risk."
341328	Now let's look at a basic fact of our digital lives, online ads.
341329	Right?
341330	We kind of dismiss them.
341331	They seem crude, ineffective.
341332	We've all had the experience of being followed on the web by an ad based on something we searched or read.
341333	You know, you look up a pair of boots and for a week, those boots are following you around everywhere you go.
341334	Even after you succumb and buy them, they're still following you around.
341335	We're kind of inured to that kind of basic, cheap manipulation.
341336	We roll our eyes and we think, "You know what?
341337	These things don't work." Except, online, the digital technologies are not just ads.
341338	Now, to understand that, let's think of a physical world example.
341339	You know how, at the checkout counters at supermarkets, near the cashier, there's candy and gum at the eye level of kids?
341340	That's designed to make them whine at their parents just as the parents are about to sort of check out.
341341	Now, that's a persuasion architecture.
341342	It's not nice, but it kind of works.
341343	That's why you see it in every supermarket.
341344	Now, in the physical world, such persuasion architectures are kind of limited, because you can only put so many things by the cashier. Right?
341345	And the candy and gum, it's the same for everyone, even though it mostly works only for people who have whiny little humans beside them.
341346	In the physical world, we live with those limitations.
341347	In the digital world, though, persuasion architectures can be built at the scale of billions and they can target, infer, understand and be deployed at individuals one by one by figuring out your weaknesses, and they can be sent to everyone's phone private screen, so it's not visible to us.
341348	And that's different.
341349	And that's just one of the basic things that artificial intelligence can do.
341350	Now, let's take an example.
341351	Let's say you want to sell plane tickets to Vegas. Right?
341352	So in the old world, you could think of some demographics to target based on experience and what you can guess.
341353	You might try to advertise to, oh, men between the ages of 25 and 35, or people who have a high limit on their credit card, or retired couples.
341354	Right?
341355	That's what you would do in the past.
341356	With big data and machine learning, that's not how it works anymore.
341357	So to imagine that, think of all the data that Facebook has on you: every status update you ever typed, every Messenger conversation, every place you logged in from, all your photographs that you uploaded there.
341358	If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them, too.
341359	Increasingly, it tries to match you with your offline data.
341360	It also purchases a lot of data from data brokers.
341361	It could be everything from your financial records to a good chunk of your browsing history.
341362	Right?
341363	In the US, such data is routinely collected, collated and sold.
341364	In Europe, they have tougher rules.
341365	So what happens then is, by churning through all that data, these machine-learning algorithms — that's why they're called learning algorithms — they learn to understand the characteristics of people who purchased tickets to Vegas before.
341366	When they learn this from existing data, they also learn how to apply this to new people. So if they're presented with a new person, they can classify whether that person is likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not.
341367	Fine.
341368	You're thinking, an offer to buy tickets to Vegas.
341369	I can ignore that.
341370	But the problem isn't that.
341371	The problem is, we no longer really understand how these complex algorithms work.
341372	We don't understand how they're doing this categorization.
341373	It's giant matrices, thousands of rows and columns, maybe millions of rows and columns, and not the programmers and not anybody who looks at it, even if you have all the data, understands anymore how exactly it's operating any more than you'd know what I was thinking right now if you were shown a cross section of my brain.
341374	It's like we're not programming anymore, we're growing intelligence that we don't truly understand.
341375	And these things only work if there's an enormous amount of data, so they also encourage deep surveillance on all of us so that the machine learning algorithms can work.
341376	That's why Facebook wants to collect all the data it can about you. The algorithms work better.
341377	So let's push that Vegas example a bit.
341378	What if the system that we do not understand was picking up that it's easier to sell Vegas tickets to people who are bipolar and about to enter the manic phase.
341379	Such people tend to become overspenders, compulsive gamblers.
341380	They could do this, and you'd have no clue that's what they were picking up on.
341381	I gave this example to a bunch of computer scientists once and afterwards, one of them came up to me.
341382	He was troubled and he said, "That's why I couldn't publish it." I was like, "Couldn't publish what?" He had tried to see whether you can indeed figure out the onset of mania from social media posts before clinical symptoms, and it had worked, and it had worked very well, and he had no idea how it worked or what it was picking up on.
341383	Now, the problem isn't solved if he doesn't publish it, because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology, and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf.
341384	This is not very difficult anymore.
341385	Do you ever go on YouTube meaning to watch one video and an hour later you've watched 27?
341386	You know how YouTube has this column on the right that says, "Up next" and it autoplays something?
341387	It's an algorithm picking what it thinks that you might be interested in and maybe not find on your own.
341388	It's not a human editor.
341389	It's what algorithms do.
341390	It picks up on what you have watched and what people like you have watched, and infers that that must be what you're interested in, what you want more of, and just shows you more.
341391	It sounds like a benign and useful feature, except when it isn't.
341392	So in 2016, I attended rallies of then-candidate Donald Trump to study as a scholar the movement supporting him.
341393	I study social movements, so I was studying it, too.
341394	And then I wanted to write something about one of his rallies, so I watched it a few times on YouTube.
341395	YouTube started recommending to me and autoplaying to me white supremacist videos in increasing order of extremism.
341396	If I watched one, it served up one even more extreme and autoplayed that one, too.
341397	If you watch Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders content, YouTube recommends and autoplays conspiracy left, and it goes downhill from there.
341398	Well, you might be thinking, this is politics, but it's not.
341399	This isn't about politics.
341400	This is just the algorithm figuring out human behavior.
341401	I once watched a video about vegetarianism on YouTube and YouTube recommended and autoplayed a video about being vegan.
341402	It's like you're never hardcore enough for YouTube.
341403	(Laughter)
341404	So what's going on?
341405	Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary, but here's what I think is going on.
341406	The algorithm has figured out that if you can entice people into thinking that you can show them something more hardcore, they're more likely to stay on the site watching video after video going down that rabbit hole while Google serves them ads.
341407	Now, with nobody minding the ethics of the store, these sites can profile people who are Jew haters, who think that Jews are parasites and who have such explicit anti-Semitic content, and let you target them with ads.
341408	They can also mobilize algorithms to find for you look-alike audiences, people who do not have such explicit anti-Semitic content on their profile but who the algorithm detects may be susceptible to such messages, and lets you target them with ads, too. Now, this may sound like an implausible example, but this is real.
341409	ProPublica investigated this and found that you can indeed do this on Facebook, and Facebook helpfully offered up suggestions on how to broaden that audience. BuzzFeed tried it for Google, and very quickly they found, yep, you can do it on Google, too.
341410	And it wasn't even expensive.
341411	The ProPublica reporter spent about 30 dollars to target this category.
341412	So last year, Donald Trump's social media manager disclosed that they were using Facebook dark posts to demobilize people, not to persuade them, but to convince them not to vote at all.
341413	And to do that, they targeted specifically, for example, African-American men in key cities like Philadelphia, and I'm going to read exactly what he said.
341414	They were using "nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that only the people we want to see it see it.
341415	What's in those dark posts?
341416	We have no idea. Facebook won't tell us.
341417	So Facebook also algorithmically arranges the posts that your friends put on Facebook, or the pages you follow.
341418	It doesn't show you everything chronologically.
341419	It puts the order in the way that the algorithm thinks will entice you to stay on the site longer.
341420	Now, so this has a lot of consequences.
341421	You may be thinking somebody is snubbing you on Facebook. The algorithm may never be showing your post to them.
341422	The algorithm is prioritizing some of them and burying the others.
341423	Experiments show that what the algorithm picks to show you can affect your emotions.
341424	But that's not all.
341425	It also affects political behavior.
341426	So in 2010, in the midterm elections, Facebook did an experiment on 61 million people in the US that was disclosed after the fact.
341427	So some people were shown, "Today is election day," the simpler one, and some people were shown the one with that tiny tweak with those little thumbnails of your friends who clicked on "I voted." This simple tweak.
341428	OK?
341429	So the pictures were the only change, and that post shown just once turned out an additional 340,000 voters in that election, according to this research as confirmed by the voter rolls.
341430	A fluke?
341431	No.
341432	Because in 2012, they repeated the same experiment.
341433	And that time, that civic message shown just once turned out an additional 270,000 voters.
341434	For reference, the 2016 US presidential election was decided by about 100,000 votes.
341435	Now, Facebook can also very easily infer what your politics are, even if you've never disclosed them on the site.
341436	Right?
341437	These algorithms can do that quite easily.
341438	What if a platform with that kind of power decides to turn out supporters of one candidate over the other?
341439	How would we even know about it?
341440	Now, we started from someplace seemingly innocuous — online adds following us around — and we've landed someplace else.
341441	As a public and as citizens, we no longer know if we're seeing the same information or what anybody else is seeing, and without a common basis of information, little by little, public debate is becoming impossible, and we're just at the beginning stages of this.
341442	These algorithms can quite easily infer things like your people's ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age and genders, just from Facebook likes.
341443	These algorithms can identify protesters even if their faces are partially concealed.
341444	These algorithms may be able to detect people's sexual orientation just from their dating profile pictures.
341445	Now, these are probabilistic guesses, so they're not going to be 100 percent right, but I don't see the powerful resisting the temptation to use these technologies just because there are some false positives, which will of course create a whole other layer of problems.
341446	Imagine what a state can do with the immense amount of data it has on its citizens.
341447	China is already using face detection technology to identify and arrest people.
341448	And here's the tragedy: we're building this infrastructure of surveillance authoritarianism merely to get people to click on ads.
341449	And this won't be Orwell's authoritarianism.
341450	This isn't "1984." Now, if authoritarianism is using overt fear to terrorize us, we'll all be scared, but we'll know it, we'll hate it and we'll resist it.
341451	But if the people in power are using these algorithms to quietly watch us, to judge us and to nudge us, to predict and identify the troublemakers and the rebels, to deploy persuasion architectures at scale and to manipulate individuals one by one using their personal, individual weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and if they're doing it at scale through our private screens so that we don't even know what our fellow citizens and neighbors are seeing, that authoritarianism will envelop us like a spider's web and we may not even know we're in it.
341452	So Facebook's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars.
341453	It's because it works great as a persuasion architecture.
341454	But the structure of that architecture is the same whether you're selling shoes or whether you're selling politics.
341455	The algorithms do not know the difference.
341456	The same algorithms set loose upon us to make us more pliable for ads are also organizing our political, personal and social information flows, and that's what's got to change.
341457	Now, don't get me wrong, we use digital platforms because they provide us with great value.
341458	I use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family around the world.
341459	I've written about how crucial social media is for social movements.
341460	I have studied how these technologies can be used to circumvent censorship around the world.
341461	But it's not that the people who run, you know, Facebook or Google are maliciously and deliberately trying to make the country or the world more polarized and encourage extremism.
341462	I read the many well-intentioned statements that these people put out.
341463	But it's not the intent or the statements people in technology make that matter, it's the structures and business models they're building.
341464	And that's the core of the problem.
341465	Either Facebook is a giant con of half a trillion dollars and ads don't work on the site, it doesn't work as a persuasion architecture, or its power of influence is of great concern. It's either one or the other.
341466	So what can we do?
341467	This needs to change.
341468	Now, I can't offer a simple recipe, because we need to restructure the whole way our digital technology operates.
341469	Everything from the way technology is developed to the way the incentives, economic and otherwise, are built into the system.
341470	We have to face and try to deal with the lack of transparency created by the proprietary algorithms, the structural challenge of machine learning's opacity, all this indiscriminate data that's being collected about us.
341471	We have a big task in front of us.
341472	We have to mobilize our technology, our creativity and yes, our politics so that we can build artificial intelligence that supports us in our human goals but that is also constrained by our human values.
341473	And I understand this won't be easy.
341474	We might not even easily agree on what those terms mean.
341475	But if we take seriously how these systems that we depend on for so much operate, I don't see how we can postpone this conversation anymore.
341476	These structures are organizing how we function and they're controlling what we can and we cannot do.
341477	And many of these ad-financed platforms, they boast that they're free.
341478	In this context, it means that we are the product that's being sold.
341479	We need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest-bidding authoritarian or demagogue.
341480	(Applause)
341481	So to go back to that Hollywood paraphrase, we do want the prodigious potential of artificial intelligence and digital technology to blossom, but for that, we must face this prodigious menace, open-eyed and now.
341482	Thank you.
341483	(Applause)
341484	In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, fathers are usually known by their sons, but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter, and I am proud of it.
341485	(Applause)
341486	Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007, and when her efforts were honored in 2011, and she was given the national youth peace prize, and she became a very famous, very popular young girl of her country. Before that, she was my daughter, but now I am her father.
341487	You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the very beginning, when a girl is born, her birth is not celebrated.
341488	She is not welcomed, neither by father nor by mother.
341489	The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother, and nobody congratulates the father.
341490	And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child.
341491	When she gives birth to the first girl child, first daughter, she is sad.
341492	When she gives birth to the second daughter, she is shocked, and in the expectation of a son, when she gives birth to a third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
341493	Not only the mother suffers, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffers too.
341494	At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school.
341495	Until the age of 12, somehow, she has a good life.
341496	She can have fun.
341497	She can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly.
341498	But when she enters her teens, when she becomes 13 years old, she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort.
341499	She is confined under the four walls of her home.
341500	She is no more a free individual.
341501	She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family, and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor, she could even be killed.
341502	And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor, it does not only affect the life of a girl, it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
341503	I know a family of seven sisters and one brother, and that one brother, he has migrated to the Gulf countries, to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents, because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood.
341504	So this brother, he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called honor.
341505	And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience. A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very submissive.
341506	It is the criteria.
341507	The role model good girl should be very quiet.
341508	She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders, even if she does not like them.
341509	If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man, she has to accept, because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient.
341510	If she is married very early, she has to accept.
341511	Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.
341512	And what happens at the end?
341513	In the words of a poetess, she is wedded, bedded, and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.
341514	And it is the irony of the situation that this mother, she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons.
341515	And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
341516	Ladies and gentlemen, this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently, if women and men think differently, if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries, if they can break a few norms of family and society, if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states, which go against the basic human rights of the women.
341517	Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn children, to be honest, but when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me, I got extremely honored.
341518	And long before she was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
341519	Her name was Malalai of Maiwand, and I named my daughter after her.
341520	A few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came — and it was a coincidence — he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
341521	But when I looked, all were men, and I picked my pen, drew a line from my name, and wrote, "Malala."
341522	And when she grow old, when she was four and a half years old, I admitted her in my school.
341523	You will be asking, then, why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school?
341524	Yes, I must mention it.
341525	It may be taken for granted in Canada, in America, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of girl.
341526	Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name.
341527	Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life.
341528	I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you will be astonished, two weeks before, when I was filling out the Canadian visa form, and I was filling out the family part of the form, I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters.
341529	And the reason was that I have never, never seen the names of my sisters written on any document. That was the reason that I valued my daughter.
341530	What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daughters, I thought I must change it.
341531	I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter.
341532	I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come.
341533	I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.
341534	And all these good values, I tried to inculcate in her personality.
341535	And this was not only she, only Malala.
341536	I imparted all these good values to my school, girl students and boy students as well. I used education for emancipation.
341537	I taught my girls, I taught my girl students, to unlearn the lesson of obedience.
341538	I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
341539	Dear brothers and sisters, we were striving for more rights for women, and we were struggling to have more, more and more space for the women in society.
341540	But we came across a new phenomenon.
341541	It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights.
341542	It was called Talibanization.
341543	It means a complete negation of women's participation in all political, economical and social activities. Hundreds of schools were lost.
341544	Girls were prohibited from going to school.
341545	Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped from going to the markets.
341546	Musicians were silenced, girls were flogged and singers were killed.
341547	Millions were suffering, but few spoke, and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog, and you speak for your rights.
341548	It's really the most scary thing.
341549	At the age of 10, Malala stood, and she stood for the right of education. She wrote a diary for the BBC blog, she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and she spoke from every platform she could.
341550	And her voice was the most powerful voice.
341551	It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
341552	And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign, and on October 9 2012, she was shot in the head at point blank range.
341553	It was a doomsday for my family and for me.
341554	The world turned into a big black hole.
341555	While my daughter was on the verge of life and death, I whispered into the ears of my wife, "Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter?"
341556	And she abruptly told me, "Please don't blame yourself.
341557	You stood for the right cause. You put your life at stake for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you.
341558	You both were on the right path and God will protect her."
341559	These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask this question again.
341560	When Malala was in the hospital, and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife.
341561	But my daughter never complained.
341562	She used to tell us, "I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face. I'll be okay.
341563	Please don't worry." She was a solace for us, and she consoled us.
341564	Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times, and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, she is like any 16-year old girl.
341565	She cries when her homework is incomplete.
341566	She quarrels with her brothers, and I am very happy for that.
341567	People ask me, what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
341568	I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
341569	Ask me what I did not do.
341570	I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
341571	Thank you very much.
341572	Thank you very much.
341573	(Applause)
341574	These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses.
341575	They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey.
341576	We are all familiar with these mundane, everyday objects.
341577	The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them.
341578	Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war.
341579	These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years after the war.
341580	And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
341581	During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations.
341582	Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities, when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army.
341583	The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide.
341584	Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial, political, religious or ethnic group.
341585	As much as genocide is about killing. It is also about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
341586	Genocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied identity.
341587	There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime.
341588	There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them.
341589	These items are recovered from numerous mass graves, and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings, the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust.
341590	Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified.
341591	Once recovered, these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned, analyzed, catalogued and stored.
341592	Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI.
341593	These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims, but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials.
341594	Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically, but physical browsing is extremely difficult, an ineffective and painful process.
341595	Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects, they become orphans of the narrative.
341596	Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not, or they get simply shelved, out of sight and out of mind.
341597	I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse.
341598	As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.
341599	I like to move beyond raising awareness.
341600	And in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened.
341601	Photography is about empathy, and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy.
341602	In this case, I am merely a tool, a forensic, if you like, and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document.
341603	Once all the missing persons are identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain.
341604	In all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims, the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed.
341605	Thank you very much.
341606	(Applause)
341607	We live in a vast universe, on a small wet planet, where billions of years ago single-celled life forms evolved from the same elements as all non-living material around them, proliferating and radiating into an incredible ray of complex life forms.
341608	All of this— living and inanimate, microscopic and cosmic— is governed by mathematical laws with apparently arbitrary constants. And this opens up a question: If the universe is completely governed by these laws, couldn’t a powerful enough computer simulate it exactly?
341609	Could our reality actually be an incredibly detailed simulation set in place by a much more advanced civilization?
341610	This idea may sound like science fiction, but it has been the subject of serious inquiry.
341611	Philosopher Nick Bostrom advanced a compelling argument that we’re likely living in a simulation, and some scientists also think it’s a possibility.
341612	These scientists have started thinking about experimental tests to find out whether our universe is a simulation.
341613	They are hypothesizing about what the constraints of the simulation might be, and how those constraints could lead to detectable signs in the world.
341614	So where might we look for those glitches?
341615	One idea is that as a simulation runs, it might accumulate errors over time.
341616	To correct for these errors the simulators could adjust the constants in the laws of nature.
341617	These shifts could be tiny— for instance, certain constants we’ve measured with accuracies of parts per million have stayed steady for decades, so any drift would have to be on an even smaller scale.
341618	But as we gain more precision in our measurements of these constants, we might detect slight changes over time.
341619	Another possible place to look comes from the concept that finite computing power, no matter how huge, can’t simulate infinities.
341620	If space and time are continuous, then even a tiny piece of the universe has infinite points and becomes impossible to simulate with finite computing power.
341621	So a simulation would have to represent space and time in very small pieces.
341622	These would be almost incomprehensibly tiny.
341623	But we might be able to search for them by using certain subatomic particles as probes.
341624	The basic principle is this: the smaller something is, the more sensitive it will be to disruption— think of hitting a pothole on a skateboard versus in a truck.
341625	Any unit in space-time would be so small that most things would travel through it without disruption— not just objects large enough to be visible to the naked eye, but also molecules, atoms, and even electrons and most of the other subatomic particles we’ve discovered.
341626	If we do discover a tiny unit in space-time or a shifting constant in a natural law, would that prove the universe is a simulation?
341627	No— it would only be the first of many steps.
341628	There could be other explanations for each of those findings.
341629	And a lot more evidence would be needed to establish the simulation hypothesis as a working theory of nature.
341630	However many tests we design, we’re limited by some assumptions they all share.
341631	Our current understanding of the natural world on the quantum level breaks down at what’s known as the planck scale. If the unit of space-time is on this scale, we wouldn’t be able to look for it with our current scientific understanding.
341632	There’s still a wide range of things that are smaller than what’s currently observable but larger than the planck scale to investigate.
341633	Similarly, shifts in the constants of natural laws could occur so slowly that they would only be observable over the lifetime of the universe.
341634	So they could exist even if we don’t detect them over centuries or millennia of measurements.
341635	We're also biased towards thinking that our universe’s simulator, if it exists, makes calculations the same way we do, with similar computational limitations.
341636	Really, we have no way of knowing what an alien civilization’s constraints and methods would be— but we have to start somewhere.
341637	It may never be possible to prove conclusively that the universe either is, or isn’t, a simulation, but we’ll always be pushing science and technology forward in pursuit of the question: what is the nature of reality?
341638	In the next six minutes that you will listen to me, the world will have lost three mothers while delivering their babies: one, because of a severe complication; second, because she will be a teenager and her body will not be prepared for birth; but the third, only because of lack of access to basic clean tools at the time of childbirth.
341639	She will not be alone.
341640	Over one million mothers and babies die every single year in the developing world, only because of lack of access to basic cleanliness while giving birth to their babies.
341641	My journey began on a hot summer afternoon in India in 2008, when after a day of meeting women and listening to their needs, I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.
341642	As a mother, I was very curious on how she delivered babies in her house.
341643	After a deep and engaging conversation with her on how she considered it a profound calling to do what she was doing, I asked her a parting question: Do you have the tools that you need to deliver the babies?
341644	I got to see her tool. "This is what I use to separate the mother and the baby," she said.
341645	Unsure of how to react, I held this agricultural tool in my hand in shock.
341646	I took a picture of this, hugged her and walked away.
341647	My mind was flooded with reflections of my own infection that I had to struggle with for a year past childbirth despite having access to the best medical care, and memories of my conversation with my father, who had lost his mom to childbirth, on how he thought his life would be so different if she would have been just next to him growing up.
341648	As a product developer, I started my process of research.
341649	I was very excited to find that there was a product out there called the Clean Birth Kit.
341650	But I just couldn't buy one for months.
341651	They were only assembled based on availability of funding.
341652	Finally, when I got my hands on one, I was in shock again.
341653	I would never use these tools to deliver my baby, I thought. But to confirm my instincts, I went back to the women, some of whom had the experience of using this product.
341654	Lo and behold, they had the same reaction and more.
341655	The women said they would rather deliver on a floor than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over.
341656	They were absolutely right — it would cause more infection. The thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection through the baby's umbilical cord, and the blade used was the kind that men used for shaving, and they did not want it anywhere close to them.
341657	There was no incentive for anybody to redesign this product, because it was based on charity.
341658	The women were never consulted in this process.
341659	And to my surprise, the need was not only in homes but also in institutional settings with high-volume births.
341660	Situations in remote areas were even more daunting.
341661	This had to change.
341662	I made this my area of focus.
341663	I started the design process by collecting feedback, developing prototypes and engaging with various stakeholders researching global protocols.
341664	With every single prototype, we went back to the women to ensure that we had a product for them.
341665	What I learned through this process was that these women, despite their extreme poverty, placed great value on their health and well-being.
341666	They were absolutely not poor in mind.
341667	As with all of us, they would appreciate a well-designed product developed for their needs.
341668	After many iterations working with experts, medical health professionals and the women themselves, I should say it was not an easy process at all, but we had a simple and beautiful design.
341669	For a dollar more than what the existing product was offered for, at three dollars, we were able to deliver "janma," a clean birth kit in a purse.
341670	Janma, meaning "birth," contained a blood-absorbing sheet for the woman to give birth on, a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp, a bar of soap, a pair of gloves and the first cloth to wipe the baby clean.
341671	All this came packaged in a beautiful purse that was given to the mother as a gift after all her hard work, that she carried home with pride as a symbol of prosperity.
341672	One woman reacted to this gift. She said, "Is this really mine?
341673	Can I keep it?" The other one said, "Will you give me a different color when I have my next baby?"
341674	(Laughter)
341675	Better yet, a woman expressed that this was the first purse that she had ever owned in her life.
341676	The kit, aside from its symbolism and its simplicity, is designed to follow globally recommended medical protocol and serves as a behavior-change tool to follow steps one after the other.
341677	It can not only be used in homes, but also in institutional settings.
341678	To date, our kit has impacted over 600,000 mothers and babies around the world.
341679	It's a humbling experience to watch these numbers grow, and I cannot wait until we reach a hundred million.
341680	But women's health issues do not end here.
341681	There are thousands of simple issues that require low-cost interventions. We have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls and provide them with better health and well-being, they will deliver healthier and wealthier and prosperous communities.
341682	We have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to women's health issues: from reducing maternal mortality, to breaking taboos, to empowering women to take control of their own lives.
341683	This is my dream.
341684	But it is not possible to achieve it without engaging men and women alike from around the world — yes, all of you.
341685	I recently heard this lyric by Leonard Cohen: "Ring the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering.
341686	There is a crack in everything.
341687	That's how the light gets in."
341688	This is my bit of light.
341689	But we need more light.
341690	In fact, we need huge spotlights placed in the world of women's health if we need a better tomorrow.
341691	We should never forget that women are at the center of a sustainable world, and we do not exist without them.
341692	Thank you.
341693	(Applause)
